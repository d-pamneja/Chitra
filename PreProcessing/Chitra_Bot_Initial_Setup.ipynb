    "    \"\"\"One week ago, had you asked me for my pick for Screenplay of the Year-so-far, it would have hands-down been Gireesh AD’s Premalu. But now, after watching the brilliantly done Aavesham, it’s a tie. Like Gireesh, Jithu Madhavan doesn’t seem to be a fan of “plot”. He prefers to put his efforts into his characters and his writing, and Aavesham comes off like an extension of his first film, Romancham. There, a few men find themselves unleashing a spirit, an impulsive act that backfires on them. Here, a few men find themselves unleashing a gangster named Ranga – and this impulsive act, again, backfires on them. Like the ghost in Romancham, Ranga – played by Fahadh Faasil – is practically an other-worldly character. He wears spotless white. He has some ten kilos of gold on his body, in the form of rings and chains. His black handlebar moustache is complemented by his black aviator glasses. He’s multilingual, speaking Kannada and Malayalam and Hindi. He’s also one of the greatest characters ever written for the screen. On the surface, there might be this tendency to use the word “mass” for him – because he gets a lot of highlight moments befitting a mass hero that make the theatre explode. But Ranga is more. Watch him do a towel-dance after a bath, and then watch him in a fight. He doesn’t actually fight. Like an action choreographer, he asks his goons to break this guy’s arm and that guy’s leg. The magic in the writing of this character is twofold. One, it keeps us guessing whether this man is a criminal or a cartoon – the payoff at the end is huge. And two, at a subtextual level, Ranga is a spoof of everything that passes for masculinity in our mainstream movies. Jithu Madhavan takes the “good-hearted rowdy” trope and runs with it as though he invented it. And Fahadh returns the favour. The character may be all surface – all that white, all that bling – and it is entirely possible to enjoy Aavesham without taking it seriously at all. But if you dig deep, you will see that – like all good actors – Fahadh takes this cartoon character seriously, and he plays Ranga like he would play a dramatic role, with thought and total commitment and investment. It’s a glorious performance, a combination of Jim Carrey’s rubbery physicality in The Mask and the self-celebration of masculinity that we saw in Fahadh’s own Shammi from Kumbalangi Nights. Fahadh plays with Ranga’s physicality, his tonality. He balances the exaggerations with the more controlled emotions. Fahadh Faasil basically tells all insecure heroes that you don’t have to be in every scene of a movie, and yet, you can be the most unforgettable part of that movie! And how does Ranga come into the picture, in this story set in Bengaluru? Actually, for a long time, he is out of the picture. Aavesham opens in an engineering college, where the life-size model of an aeroplane is kept on display. A mother tells her son – Bibi (Mithun Jai Shankar) – that one day, he should build something similar. In other words, she wants him to soar. But the minute she enrols Bibi in a hostel and leaves, his life takes a different turn. He has two roommates, Aju (Hipzster) and Shanthan (Roshan Shahnavaz). They antagonise a senior named Kutty (Midhutty), and pay the price. They are stripped and beaten up, and then – suddenly – Kutty hands them drinks and calls them his “bros”. (This screenplay is filled with tone changes.) Apparently, every rowdy-like person likes to surround themselves with “bros”. Keep this fact in mind, because it gets a payoff at the end. In the midst of people who stick around only for booze and money, these gangsters seek people who will stick around for love, for friendship. But at the moment, Aju is in no mood to be a “bro”. The three boys are written well, and played well. Shanthan is the one who is happy following the path of least resistance. Bibi is written as someone who isn’t easy to read. His character arc is a beauty. And Aju is the alpha-male of the group. He wants revenge. He looks for a rowdy to beat up Kutty, and that’s how he and his friends find Ranga. Just wait till you see the location of the man’s “hero-introduction scene”. Ranga is at once a celebration of all things macho and a deconstruction of all things macho. There’s a sensational moment where he shows – in a stunning top-angle shot – how every goon in the bar fears him. And yet, watch that mass-hero staple of the slo-mo run being spoofed. Ranga runs in slo-mo, and… you’ll have to see the rest for yourself. Slowly, in trying to befriend Ranga, Aju and Bibi and Shanthan are drawn into his larger-than-life life and his violent actions. You can sense a subtext about being drawn to macho-ness and then being repelled by too much macho-ness – but the film is so light on its feet and so bloody fun that you may not think about any of this until much later. The jokes keep coming like bullets from a machine gun. There’s a revolver that won’t fire. There’s a spoof of the “mother sentiment” so dear to our mainstream movies. The bit woven around a grihapravesham is a riot. And there’s an amazing set piece involving a game of dumb charades, where Fahadh/Ranga goes from grinning clown to scary criminal and back to grinning clown. Sushin Shyam’s wacky score is a perfect accompaniment to the wacky proceedings. Aavesham is in no hurry to tell its story, and that’s why every character, every set piece registers so well. The action stretches are electric, with cinematography by Sameer Thahir and editing by Vivek Harshan. You get the sense of watching a massive circus event at Las Vegas, and the cutting is as smooth as silk. But also consider the dramatic stretches with other characters, who get smaller screen time. Mansoor Ali Khan plays a rowdy. He also plays the archetype for Ranga. He is who Ranga will be in a couple of decades. And Ashish Vidyarthi, as a college big shot, gets a brilliant bit where he proves that you can exude threats and gangster vibes even while wearing a suit. He owns a gun, but his choice of weapon is the English language. But after Ranga, the film’s most lovable character is Amban, the loyal sidekick played beautifully by Sajin Gopu. The man is built like a mountain (it shows especially when he stands next to Fahadh), and yet, he’s like a kid in a candy store. Every opportunity for a fight brings him great delight. Whether he is narrating Ranga’s real or imagined exploits or taking knife cuts on his back, Amban transforms the traditional sidekick character into a violent teddy bear. Not since Munna Bhai and Circuit has a rowdy pair appeared so lovable. On the surface, Aavesham may look like a big dumb action flick that asks you to leave your brains at the door, but actually, it is a very smart combination of action and comedy and drama. I loved every second of it, and I demand a sequel with Amban and Ranga.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"In Amar Singh Chamkila, Imtiaz Ali gives us two films for the price of one. The first – more obvious – narrative follows the shape of a biopic, the life and times of the “Elvis of Punjab”, played by Diljit Dosanjh. That nickname, as we come to see, isn’t just about the massive popularity Chamkila enjoyed in his lifetime. This is the 1980s, and he outsells Amitabh Bachchan in a live show. But here’s the other layer. Just like Elvis was accused of corrupting young America with dance moves resembling those of a male striptease artist and songs whose erotic energy was even wilder, Chamkila was frequently hauled up by cultural gatekeepers for his sexually charged lyrics. Irshad Kamil, who outdoes himself in the soundtrack, writes these words for Chamkila’s detractors: “ganda sa banda hai / social darinda hai”! The rise and fall of a musician who brought joy to the masses, and the question whether art ought to be censored for those very masses – these two layers come together magnificently in this movie. The film opens with much excitement, as Punjab’s most famous Ambassador car is sighted by a wedding party: they have commissioned a music performance by Chamkila and his wife Amarjot, played by Parineeti Chopra. And from then on, Imtiaz (who co-wrote the screenplay with Sajid Ali) and his brilliant editor Aarti Bajaj do their trademark thing. We get small (sometimes micro) scenes that get to the heart of the emotion in a heartbeat, and these small scenes come together like pieces in a colourful quilt. The film uses the assassination of Chamkila and Amarjot as a pivot point, and keeps going back and forth in time. There appear to be many suspects: fundamentalists, militants who rose in influence after Indira Gandhi was shot dead, rival singers, loyalists that Chamkila abandoned along the way – but this is not a lazy “who did it?” murder mystery. The real question is: Who was this man? This decision to talk about Chamkila after his killing gives the sense of the man still being alive after death, as though people could not stop talking about him. It’s like he is very much in the present even after he has become a part of the past. Put simply, it’s the idea of immortality. And the writing and  editing juxtapose faces and events with such nimbleness that we are never in doubt about who is who even though we (at least, those of us unfamiliar with Chamkila) are faced with a host of unknown names and faces. I’ll give you an example. Early on, we see a singer named Jinda in broad daylight, on stage with Chamkila. CUT TO: we get a profile shot of Jinda at night, as he adds his two bits about who Chamkila was, from his point of view. The film, thus, isn’t a definitive portrait. Rather, like a folk story passed on through the oral tradition, it is a collection of these orally narrated points of view that give us different facets and dimensions of a beloved but controversial man. At times, Chamkila himself becomes a narrator of his life. There is a great bit where he sits down to eat and appears displeased that the roti is cold. You think  the scene is about one emotion, but it quickly turns into another – and we get the feeling that perhaps it is not possible to fully know this man. In another brilliant scene, Chamkila’s father shouts at him for cutting his hair and disrespecting Sikhism, but Chamkila calmly hands over a bundle of money and the old man quiets down. As always, money solves all problems. But what were Chamkila’s own feelings about his religion? That we may never get to know. What has survived, what we know for sure, is the music – and AR Rahman hits it out of the park. The soundtrack album is superb, as is the background score. Imtiaz and Rahman fill the narrative with silences, so that we really feel and register the emotion when instruments make themselves heard behind the action: when an acoustic guitar is heard during a conversation outside a police station, when a sitar is heard as Chamkila talks to Amarjot alone for the first time, when a flute and strings are heard when Chamkila confronts another woman in his life, or when a dramatic whiplash is heard when militants enter Chamkila’s home. In a sense, Rahman’s score grows over the course of the film. The first time we see the assassination, it’s in total silence. When the same scenario is replayed at the end, we get a big orchestral score. The first time, the man is a stranger. The second time, we have come to know him to the extent that we can – so the emotion produced by the big score is truly earned. This is the rare movie that does not use its background score as a blunt instrument to pound the audience into emotional submission. There are scenes where we crave to know more about the emotional logic. Why did Chamkila leave the first woman in his life before marrying Amarjot? Why did Chamkila abandon his loyal manager before going to perform in Canada? This unknowability is emphasised with a series of distancing devices. For one, there are the photographs of the real-life Chamkila and Amarjot. Most biopics seek to maintain the illusion that the actors playing the subjects of the story are really the real people – and maybe at the end, over the credits, we may get reminders of those real people. But Imtiaz destroys this notion by constantly going back to pictures of the real Chamkila, the real Amarjot, even as Diljit and Parineeti are playing Chamkila and Amarjot on screen. Amar Singh Chamkila keeps playing with form. Whenever we listen to performances, we hear the songs in Diljit’s and Parineeti’s own voices – so there is no dissonance between the voices they speak in and the voices they sing in. But when an inner emotion is underlined (as opposed to those external performances), we get Rahman’s songs with playback singers like Mohit Chauhan, Arijit Singh, Alka Yagnik, and Jonita Gandhi. The original Punjabi lyrics are maintained in the live shows, but for those of us who don’t know the language we get Hindi equivalents of some lines – but these Hindi words are written in English. (If you are watching the film with subtitles, there is an additional distancing layer, because now you are reading the English equivalents of those lyrics.) Apart from the music, we get split screens designed like two squares on a film strip, we get animation, and when we see love bloom from Amarjot’s point of view, we get flares on the borders of the frames, like those old films where the edges of the camera were blurred out with Vaseline. Sylvester Fonseca is the cinematographer, and this is one of the rare instances we see something flashy. Otherwise, he leads us through the story with the practised casualness of turning the pages of a book. A lot of Amar Singh Chamkila is a familiar story, but the individual scenes and the actors are so good that they reinvent the broad beats – like in the bit where Chamkila and his manager hear a record playing his song and run in search of it. They find the store where the record is being played, and Diljit fingers his moustache with a small smile. He’s proud, but the gesture makes it a muted kind of pride. When he makes a reference to his Dalit roots – “Chamar hoon par bhookha nahin maroonga” – his anger is muted. Even his business sense is muted. When he meets Amarjot, he says he does not need to hear her sing because someone he trusts has vouched for her. The innocence and naïveté in Diljit’s utterly captivating performance makes Chamkila someone you root for all the way, and Parineeti, too, nicely underplays her part. On stage, she keeps looking down, as though she doesn’t want to see audiences looking at her while she is singing those songs. So why did these two people sing those songs? One plausible reason is that Chamkila had no pretences or filters, and he simply wrote the way people spoke, or simply said the things most people thought in private but would not say in public. After all, look at how the DSP speaks to his fawning subordinate: “Itna bhi makhkhan na lagao ki andar haath ghus jaaye.” Look at how women (in the song Naram kaalja) objectify a man’s organ: “Chhoti si aari leke tu kya kaatega jangal.” Look at the lewd lines sung at weddings. Even when Chamkila tries to change his image and make a devotional album (that, too, became a blockbuster), the masses want him to sing the songs that made him a star: because they need to laugh amidst their troubles, and for them, this is a valid form of entertainment. And this is what Chamkila says to a posh, jeans-wearing reporter who says he objectifies women in his songs. He does not deny that he does. But he also says, “Chhote log yehi pasand karte hain…” And by “chhote log”, he means those who are not privileged, he means the masses. The privileged people and the prudes and the conservatives complain – especially after Indira Gandhi’s death – that people are dying, and here this man is singing songs that go: “Jijaji meri kamar ka naap le lo.” Is it… appropriate? But it is at these dark times that people need entertainment, and who is to tell them what the “appropriate” form of entertainment is? Some of the older members in the audience may remember the cultural tug-of-war that erupted when “Choli ke peeche kya hai” became a blockbuster, and when Govinda and Karisma Kapoor nearly dislodged their pelvises gyrating to “Sarkailo lyo khatiya jaada lage.” Both films – Khalnayak and Raja Babu – were blockbusters. In other words, the “chhote log”, the masses lapped them up. It is the same conflict that was explored in Miloš Forman’s, The People vs. Larry Flynt, based on the man who published the pornographic Hustler magazine. If there is such a thing as freedom of expression, then should there be cultural gatekeepers or should people be left to self-censor what they want and don’t want to read or see or hear? Imtiaz does not attempt to answer this question directly, which is how it should be. This question has no definitive answer. It is how each individual responds to the issue so Imtiaz just puts up both sides and leaves it for us to decide. Chamkila says, “Why am I being targeted when other singers sing such songs, too?” Could it be jealousy? Or is it that the most popular one becomes the most sought after when you want to set an example and “do good for society”. But, indirectly, at least, Imtiaz lets us see where his sympathies lie. He is for Chamkila, and against cultural censorship. The film gives us “logical” explanations – for example, that Chamkila’s caste-mentality never really went away, that he remained a “slave” of the audience, giving them what they wanted. Another “logical” explanation we are given is that he has risen from rags to riches, and he cannot return to where he came from. Chamkila tells Amarjot that let’s make money first, “phir aaram se sochenge kya sahi hai aur kya galat.” But “emotionally” speaking, Chamkila comes off like a martyr for a cause, because of the grand eulogy Rahman gifts him: “Vida karo”. The beautifully penned words mask the sarcasm that drips through the song: “Let me go, because a dirty man like me does not deserve to be in your world of pure people.” “Tum sabhi saaf sahi / hoon matmela main…” The moving song breaks your heart, and makes you wonder what art is, and who gets to decide how it is practised or how people choose to entertain themselves. In this age of social media and rampant armchair-activism, Amar Singh Chamkila raises important questions. And yes, it is also a beautiful film.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal plays like Subhash Ghai’s version of The Godfather – and I mean this in a mostly good way. (I’ll add that to see the film this way, you have to be – like me – a lover of pulp and excess.) In the trashy Mario Puzo novel and the classy Coppola adaptation that followed, a son becomes a criminal because of an attack on his father. But what if there was a twist! What if the son already had psychopathic, criminal tendencies! What if he was already a… khalnayak! What if at least some of these criminal tendencies stemmed from the father being distant, which caused an almost pathological longing for daddy-love, which then manifested itself as territorial behaviour! What if the son is essentially telling the world, “If I cannot have a piece of my father, then neither can anyone else, not even the ones who want to kill him”! I use the word “territorial” deliberately. Ranbir Kapoor – who, as Vijay, gives everything he’s got – is the animal of the title, and he sees his father as his… “territory”. A superbly in-form (and in tune with the overheated material) Anil Kapoor plays the father, Balbir Singh. But apart from a few overheated lines, he is reduced to the weakened Don Corleone from The Godfather: a series of pained, pathetic looks at what his son has become. Sandeep recreates many moments from The Godfather, like a car explosion, or the killing of a brother-in-law, or the long opening set piece set during a (birthday) celebration, or the search for the people who attacked the father. And to this, he adds a gleeful pulp sensibility we never saw in Arjun Reddy. The sensational pre-interval fight combines men in “animal” masks, a Kabir doha, and a cheeky made-in-India reference, thanks to an automatic firing machine that acts like the biggest phallus in this movie that’s essentially about overheated men waving their dicks around. At times, Animal plays like a dark comedy. Think of the cheerfully vulgar joke about an “animal” in the opening scene, which involves another phallic object: a sword! The anecdote tells us that we are what we are, and our toxic animal nature cannot be civilised or tamed by love or any other such bullshit. There are several laugh-out-loud moments, like the echo of a joke involving pubic hair, or the overhead shot of two fighting men that resembles two children fighting in school,  or the reveal of the Bobby Deol character occurring as Vijay is finally using sign language after saying he does not want to use sign language. (There is a connection.) If you have “good taste”, do not go near this movie! You may feel like the critic Rex Reed did after watching Brian de Palma’s Scarface: he called it a pointless bloodbath that aimed only to disgust, sicken, and horrify the audience with a rampage of violence, bloodshed, and carnage. It is true that some of this criticism can be applied to Sandeep’s movie. The rampage of violence does get exhausting after a point. After you’ve been through the pre-interval bloodbath, more blood is hardly going to have the same impact. And the second half does lose steam, because it turns into a more conventional “revenge story”, and the psychological aspects get lost amidst all the bloodletting. But where the writer-director scores is in throwing in so many unconventional things into the mix that you can’t tear your eyes away from the screen. There are any number of ways a mole can enter an organisation, but you will never guess the way this scenario occurs in Animal. This requires some truly outrageous imagination that truly thinks larger than life. This quality is the film’s beating heart. That body double – what an idea! After a point, the Mahabharata peeks in, with a war between blood relations. There is even a grand yagna! The women – Rashmika Mandanna as Vijay’s wife, Tripti Dimri as a lover – don”t get much to do. In Arjun Reddy, we followed the protagonist’s point of view throughout. So when the woman left his life, we never saw her until he met her again. (There were no cutaway scenes showing what was happening to her in parallel.) But that is not the case here. Animal is not written from that kind of subjective viewpoint. So we want more from Rashmika’s character than just slapping her husband around, which appears like Sandeep answering his Arjun Reddy critics. She does get a solid scene woven around her husband’s infidelity, but it goes on too long and it does not have the desired impact.  But think about the reference to her child-bearing hips. On the surface, it sounds crass, but that is an evolutionary way of choosing a woman for marriage in the “animal” kingdom. The meaning of the title never leaves the film. It is there in the lines, the behaviours… and even in a brand of underwear. (I told you this was a dark comedy.) The film breaks every storytelling rule. We learn of a killing, and then we learn of the reason behind the killing. This is not intended to create suspense (which is the usual reason), but to create shock, to keep us off-balance. The startling cuts (Sandeep is also the editor) also help. Even rhythm-wise, we are kept off-balance. You could ask if the film really needed so much. What, for instance, if they had edited out the scene with the priest saying Vijay’s days are numbered? But again, you go back to the first scene (in black-and-white) and see that Vijay lives to be 60. Everything is interconnected. There is a clean vision. If there is a Hindu yagna, there is a Christian priest, we get Sikh relatives, and we also get a Muslim wedding. When the hero is almost down and out in a fight, he recalls his father’s words and that brings him back to life. This is a grand, all-inclusive masala world, but in a post-millennial way. Like in Khalnayak, the man with “villain” qualities is the “hero”, but unlike those earlier movies, the moral lines are blurred. Vijay is so lost in the wars in own head – as his wife tells him – that he doesn’t seem to have an end goal in mind. “Getting his father’s approval” may have been the original end goal, but after a while, he behaves like a pure animal, doing exactly what he wants to do, with none of the boundaries of “civilisation”. When his sister is teased, he lets loose a machine gun in school. He tells his wife he will never cheat on her, and then he does. Not even the sight of a pregnant woman whose water has just broken can soften him, any more than a lion is going to pity an infant gazelle. Prey is prey. Like Arjun Reddy, Animal appears like a no-holds-barred, uncensored wallow inside the director’s head. Sandeep definitely seems to be putting bits of himself out there. If Arjun Reddy had a derogatory attitude towards a “fat girl”, Vijay’s father here yells that Vijay is “putting on weight like a pig”. Sandeep puts out his id. He puts out moments that other directors may be too embarrassed to show that they even think of, even for fictional purposes – like one where Vijay walks naked, or when he tells his wife not to remarry after his death, or when he tortures her by tugging and releasing her bra strap. The act leaves red marks on her back the way Vijay’s schoolteacher’s caning left a red mark on his palm. I can’t say I liked Animal in its entirety, but amidst so many filmmakers whose work seems either derivative or boring or award-seeking or critical-approval-seeking, this rawness is exhilarating. I think those of us who like these movies may do so because – at least for three hours – they bring out the animal in us that we keep caged at all other times. \"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"There are two kinds of 'shooting' in Karthik Subbaraj's new movie: the kind you do with the gun, and the kind you do with a movie camera. At one point, there's a standoff between these two kinds of shooting: a man points his gun at a man who points a camera back at him. Jigarthanda DoubleX is not about which man 'wins'. But if you have seen Part 1, I don't think you'll be surprised to learn what this film's message is. It's this: Cinema is the most powerful weapon we have. And the beauty – the real beauty – of this message is that it is not presented as a stagy speech, or as mere words. It is presented as… a piece of cinema. It is played out on a big screen, as a film within a film. If the message is about the medium, this medium is how the message is conveyed. The meta-ness is exhilarating. There are several films within Jigarthanda DoubleX, and let's first look at the most obvious one: the sequel to the 2014 film starring Siddharth, Bobby Simha and Lakshmi Menon. The parallels are many. There's the name 'Sethu', the famous brother-sister song from Pasamalar, the central “story” that a criminal's autobiography is being made into a movie. There's an instance of double-crossing, and the true intent of the filmmaker remains unknown to the gangster – again, just like in Part 1. There's cinema being created under a false pretext, and then, there's the magic of cinema itself. When a filmmaker says 'Action!', he feels something coursing through him, like electricity. His actor feels something, too. But these references apart, DoubleX is not really an extension of Jigarthanda. You see why Karthik calls it 'a sequel in spirit'.  The opening scenes set up a forest-dwelling Veerappan-like criminal who kills elephants for tusks. To make things worse for the tribals who live there, we have a ganja-smoking State-appointed cop with zero conscience. To counter this man, this menace, this bad cop, it's not just enough to bring in a good cop. A line of dialogue suggests that something much more is needed, almost like a messiah. And that messiah is… cinema. The people speaking these lines don't know that yet, and neither do we – because Karthik diverts us by mimicking the dynamics of the earlier film. He introduces us to a tribal-rowdy named Caesar and a filmmaker named Kirubai, played by Raghava Lawrence and SJ Suryah. The third \"hero\" in this film is Clint Eastwood, who's there from start to finish as an almost spiritual presence. The scene that has Caesar in a shootout in front of the 'Let Red go' bit from For a Few Dollars More… it's cine-geek heaven!. Everything in DoubleX loops back to Cinema. Kirubai wants to become a cop. Thanks to cinema, he becomes a dispenser of justice and brings down the bad guys. Caesar is a gunda. Thanks to cinema, his story is diverted into the forest, and there he regains his humanity. The politician played by Ilavarasu says he wants to be the CM. Much later, thanks to cinema, he realises that there are other ways to serve people. There's also the sense that things are fair in cinema in a way they aren't in real life. Look at Clint Eastwood in his films – he never shoots an unarmed man. Even the echo of a scene from Part 1 where a man is burnt alive has to do with cinema. Here, a man is covered with celluloid reels and set on fire. There are fun and games. A bit about a veena made me laugh out loud, as did the mispronunciation of 'pan-India' as 'Pandya'. And I loved the MacGuffin: we are made to think that this is about the creation of a dark-skinned hero (and given Karthik's Rajinikanth fandom, I really thought it would be a veiled story of Rajinikanth). But no! That's where the story begins, sure, but that's not where it ends. The ending is – again – about cinema. It is about a reel-life leading man becoming a real-life hero. But this is not a fun-and-games movie. It is far more serious in tone than its predecessor, and it is Karthik’s most political movie to date. You could point to Mercury and say that that film, too, was about an issue. But there, the issue was folded into a larger “genre” story. Here, the issue is right out in front, and this is one of the rare times I have seen a “message movie” work in Tamil cinema. On the surface, we have seen many Tamil films speak out about issues and against the government, but not in this way, not with so much love for cinema, and not with so much craft. Karthik has always been a dynamic filmmaker, but here, with his fantastic cinematographer Thirunavukkarasu, he creates deep frames filled with life. There’s always something happening in some corner, and Shafique Mohamed Ali’s editing sweeps us from frame to frame without the dynamism being lost. We seem to be in constant motion. Then, of course, we have Santhosh Narayanan’s score, which takes its cues from Spaghetti Westerns. There are many films that do not need a score at all, but something as visually and dramatically flamboyant as DoubleX is impossible to imagine without the whistling and the trumpets and the cheeky little harmonica.  What could have been better? Shine Tom Chacko is a star with political ambitions. Nimisha Sajayan is Caesar's wife. They don't get much to do. A plot point about epileptic fits is very clever in terms of how it comes back into the story, but the person never experiences this condition again and I wondered why. After the film is over, you see the Big Picture of the narrative – but while watching it, I kept fidgeting a bit, wondering where it was heading. Of course, that, ultimately, is part of the charm. But maybe these diversions could have been smoother. But these are small complaints in the face of this massive achievement, which is also an ode to Nature, to the tribal way of life. When an oracle says that these men will get what they want but not in the way they expect, it's a reminder of the unpredictability of life itself. It is a throwaway scene, but it is so profound.  When you see a wild animal give birth, when you see the mothers of the herd helping the infant, and when you see forests on the verge of vanishing, you may realise that your petty squabbles and revenge fantasies are irrelevant in the larger scheme of things. Karthik has rarely been so deeply emotional in his cinema, and his leading men have rarely been better. SJ Suryah keeps finding new ways to exploit his innate “actorliness”, and here we get a poignant shade of the actor. As for Raghava Lawrence, I can’t say I have seen him in anything requiring him to act, but he’s wonderful here. You cannot imagine another performer in his place. DoubleX ends with the promise of a sequel, but whatever the plot of that film is, I am sure it will continue the tradition of showcasing its creator’s love for cinema, for art.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s superb new movie is based on real events, as recorded in Anurag Pathak’s book, 12th Fail. It features Vikrant Massey as Manoj, a young man from the Chambal region who, inspired by a policeman, wants to become one himself. And what inspires him about this policeman? His tendency to tell the truth. It must also help that Manoj’s father is himself a satyavadi. The man is suspended after refusing to aid the lie that the area’s farmers got the seeds they were allotted. (The unsurprising truth is that government officers sold the seeds in the black market.) The result of this suspension is a very funny scene with guns, which shows that we are in a dreaded dacoit-land, where firearms are whipped out for the smallest of disputes.  The odds are against Manoj, because the UPSC exam is a distant dream for someone from his background. (A character says, out of two-lakh ‘Hindi-medium’ aspirants for IAS/IPS, only 25-30 get selected.) And we find ourselves in an underdog story. Unlike the usual “triumph of the spirit” crap usually dished out by the movies, we seem to be watching the life and times of a very real man and not the life and times of a templated narrative arc. Walking into 12th Fail, I wondered: How can the story of a man studying for the UPSC exams be made… well, un-boring? Here’s how. The writing is a marvel of small things that add up to grand payoffs. Look at the way Manoj’s grandmother refuses to part with her pension, even when the family is in the direst of situations. And when she finally parts with this money – willingly – and when something happens to this money, the event hits you like a lead brick.  The screenplay is littered with lead bricks. The part where the words “terrorism” and “tourism” play off one another. The part where the father says, “Hum jaise log kahaan jeet paayenge,” and the bright-eyed son replies, “Par haar bhi nahin maanenge na!” The rousing mini-slogan (#Restart), which says that even if you hit rock bottom, you can always begin the climb all over again. The quiet rebellion of the heroine, Shraddha, played by Medha Shankar (in fact, the way the whole 'friendship to romance' angle is written). Everything starts soft and hits hard. Only in the final portions – say, when an intimidating examiner looms large in the frame – do we feel we have entered a zone that’s a little “filmy”, but only a little, and only because the preceding stretches have been so remarkably underplayed. At several points, my eyes went moist. There’s nothing showy, and even a shot where Manoj is reflected in the rear-view mirror of a vehicle has meaning, a purpose. The result is some of the purest filmmaking I’ve seen. And this purity reflects in every single performance. Medha Shankar is a fragile presence, but inside, she is all steel. As for Vikrant, he knows he has the role he has been waiting for, the role of a lifetime: he grabs it and runs with it. Manoj is a Kalam-reading idealist, who’s stubborn about the way he wants to get ahead. So the lines that drop from him don’t sound like preachy lectures, even when the line itself is a preachy mini-lecture. A cop tells Manoj: “Chhote se ho, par dum hai tum mein”. Vikrant uses his slight stature to suggest the internal strength of an underdog. He may not look strong, but inside, he’s Atlas. His eyes are ablaze with the crazy-light we see in great eccentrics. There’s no shame in him that he’s doing menial jobs to survive, because these are honest and truthful ways to survive.  And that is the film’s crux: not that a “12th-fail” Hindi-medium student achieves his dream, but that he does so in an honest and truthful manner. This is usually the kind of “noble” premise that makes me do a quick U-turn and run for my life, but 12th Fail is so light on its feet. Like its protagonist, the film itself feels truthful and honest. Everything is one of a piece. When Manoj goes from his village to a big city (Gwalior) and then to a bigger city (Delhi), he loses things, he gains a male friend (Sanjay Bishnoi), he gains a female friend in Shraddha, he gets betrayed and rejected and accepted again, a clock keeps ticking away (literally), and Fate keeps playing Snakes and Ladders with him – and all of this is captured like the flow of life, without pausing for effect or to highlight the melodramatic potential in a situation. 12th Fail is one of the rare mainstream films that uses music sparingly. The score, reminiscent of Ravi Shankar’s plaintive music for Pather Panchali, is made from  a few Indian instruments, and it plays at the end of scenes rather than over them. The music – therefore – feels earned, like a reward for something that has just happened. So if we feel what we feel, it is due to the acting and the staging and the direction, and not because a solo violin is tugging at our heartstrings and saying, “Cry, cry, cry…” This can only come from a confident filmmaker, and his confidence is infectious. Rangarajan Ramabadran’s handheld cinematography is the equivalent of a fly on the wall, moving in close when Shraddha begins to sing, or rushing downstairs with Manoj, or registering the unsteadiness of a single emotional man in a sea of people. The gentlest focus shift happens when Shraddha argues with her father, and the one track/trolley overhead shot occurs when Manoj walks into a room filled with people like him, to show him in the midst of many. 12th Fail strips away all artifice from filmmaking. It proves that you can show real-life struggles of the underprivileged without it all feeling like you are reading a finger-wagging newspaper editorial by a buttoned-up academic. Even the interval-point high: we may hear a ringing sound, but the scene itself is muted. Even the “I love you” scene: it’s wistful and it produces an emotional high, especially with the closure against the backdrop of pink mountain skies, but the sequence itself is played in a minor key. Even the midway scene where Manoj returns home as a failure: it contains a breakdown, but does not contain melodrama. The feelings come from Manoj and from the people around him, and they aren’t “calculated” to make the audience feel – and that’s why we feel these emotions all the more. The less we are manipulated, the more we respect the film, the filmmaking. In that respect, 12th Fail earns top marks.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"There is an early scene in SU Arun Kumar's Chithha where Sakthi (Nimisha Sajayan) has to use a public toilet. The floor is dirty, and filled with water. A woman who has used the stall Sakthi is standing in line for opens the door and leaves without cleaning up. Sakthi calls her back, forcefully, and makes her clean up. This small moment tells us a lot about Sakthi – for instance, she is not one to take things lying down. And this display of strength blooms fully when she runs into Eswaran (Siddharth), her one-time boyfriend who left her without an explanation. Even without the toilet scene, even if Sakthi had shown her anger only after she ran into Eswaran, we would have had an insight into her emotions – but that early scene tells us how, even in the absence of Eswaran, Sakthi is determined not to be a pushover again. We see who she is, and then we see why she became that way.  This is beautiful character-writing, and it's all over this film, which centres on the loving relationship between Eswaran and his dead brother's daughter (Sundari, played by the excellent Sahasra Shree). Eswaran has become the little girl's kinda-sorta foster father, and his relationship with his sister-in-law (Anjali Nair) is equally solid. He is the man of the house, and the situation is so lived-in and so comfortable that there's no awkwardness when they are in close proximity in a cramped kitchen or when he is buying sanitary napkins for her. They give off bestie vibes, and it works wonderfully. There's no weeping, no wailing about the past. These are two people who have accepted a situation and have moved on and are trying to make the best of what life is throwing at them. The chemistry between Siddharth and Anjali Nair is remarkably understated – and that is the flavour of most of the first half. The A-for-apple background score kills the mood frequently. When Eswaran picks his cute niece up from school, we hear cutesy music, which totally undermines the emotion he was feeling when he met his ex just a little while ago. Each stretch is scored to hype up whatever emotion it represents, and this is an inevitable evil we have come to accept in our cinema. But to compensate, Balaji Subramanyam's cinematography is exquisitely “invisible”. Arun Kumar, in his earlier films, has never displayed this kind of eye for staging, and a lot of the time, we get two or three things being swept into a single, economical, non-showy camera movement. After a mid-shot featuring a female cop (a superb newcomer named Jhansi), the camera follows her as she turns, and we get a wide shot featuring Eeswaran somewhere in the distance. This sort of thing keeps happening over and over, and the camera is alive to both the general environment and the particular proceedings in this story, whether it’s a man fixing a street light or Eswaran crying his heart out in the bathroom. The frames are to die for. Another fantastic bit of staging occurs when the actors move out of the frame, and the camera stays fixated on an empty street – we do not see what these actors are doing beyond the field of the camera. And what exactly did they do? What happened, exactly? The mystery in the visual ties neatly into the unknowability of what really happened. Eswaran is accused of sexually abusing a little girl, and the screenplay and the editing take these portions to soaring heights. There's not one cliche in how all this information is presented to us. Add to this Siddharth's most sincere, committed, and affecting performance to date, and we are left shattered. This portion brings to fore the very crux of child abuse – that a lot of the time, the perpetrator is someone as close and as 'likeable' as Eswaran. The screenplay measures out what we need to know in 'real time', just like how the characters who have experienced these events would recall them, instead of dumping us with big stretches of exposition. So even though the love track isn't strictly 'necessary' in this story of abuse, it fits smoothly because it was a part of Eswaran before the movie began and it looks like an organic extension of his life now. We are spared the 'falling in love' moment, though we do get a fantastic duet: ‘Kangal edho theda’, composed by Dhibu Ninan Thomas. This lived-in quality, this ability of the film to suggest that its characters have had lives before we meet them, is its greatest strength. Everyone seems so fully-formed, so real. And these are not perfect characters, either. Sundari ends up stealing something, and we get to see the peer pressure a little girl faces at school. Suresh A Prasad is the editor. His sharp rhythms (which could also be an offshoot of the screenplay) keep preventing the scenes from getting into obvious zones. For instance, after Sundari's mother slaps her, we cut to a serene scene of the child sleeping with her 'chithha', her chittappa Eswaran. Even a conflict that’s yet to come is built up carefully, with Eswaran humiliating a man by accidentally shoving him into a gutter. And later, when this man turns on Eswaran, you know where the extra animosity is coming from. The parts that stick out are the ones that let us know in advance what lies ahead: when two cops talk about the rape of a minor a few scenes before a little girl gets into an auto, there is no surprise left. After this point is where I felt the film made a misstep. When you are wrongfully accused of a horrible crime by the very people you love, when your sister-in-law suddenly changes the way she looks at you, when your close friend suspects you, one part inside you surely dies – as we saw in the wonderful Danish film, The Hunt. I felt Chithha needed to dwell on Eswaran’s emotions a little more – but he bounces back into action almost as though this were a minor blip in his life, as the film splits into two very different tracks. (You could say the first half of the film looks inward, while the second half is all outward.) One track is a procedural about the hunt for a serial child molester. The other track is about Eswaran’s turning into a vigilante, determined to kill the bad guy. Yes, you could argue that this latter aspect of Eswaran has a lot to do with his humiliation after being falsely accused, but the emotions needed to be way deeper – because in his own way, the (wrongfully) accused suffers as much as the abused. I also wished Sakthi’s revelation at the end had not tied so neatly into the film’s overall themes. Nimisha Sajayan, of course, totally sells the moment. She is incapable of giving a dishonest performance. But it’s too much. It’s too convenient. So yes, the second half feels looser and less intense. The villain’s scenes seem caricaturish when compared to the scenes with everyone else. And a sense of predictability sets in when we see Sundari. (Why didn’t they keep the suspense of whether she is still alive?) We seem to be in a regular thriller. But even in the portions where, say, a clue is found rather randomly, the filmmaking is so good that you easily let go of these misgivings. When Eswaran breaks down after believing Sundari is dead, the camera allows him to retain his dignity by not going close. It stays wide, at a respectable distance. You may question where the film goes, but whatever choices the director makes, he sticks to them with utter conviction. Even the many shots of Eswaran sleeping beside his niece have a devastating payoff in a mortuary. Chithha  shows us all aspects of child rape, from the way cases are conducted to the attitudes that need changing. Sakthi tells Eswaran that it’s not about punishing the villain as much as being there for Sundari at a time she really needs him. At this point, the Hero is emasculated, and in a good way. He gets rid of his toxic “heroism”, and realises that it’s better to be a hero to his niece than to be the hero who conquers the villain. To accomplish all this in a “mainstream” format is a truly remarkable achievement.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"When Christopher Nolan announced a biopic, of all things, I was curious. It's like Hitchcock making a Fred Astaire musical. It's like Spielberg making Saw. It's like Scorsese making a screwball comedy or a Western. There's nothing to say that a filmmaker cannot change pace, and before he became Christropher Nolan™, we did get a superb psychological thriller in Insomnia. But now that he's trademarked as one of the biggest filmmakers (who makes films as big as his reputation, with big IMAX cameras for big IMAX screens), what could have possibly interested him in the intricacies and intimacies of \"normal life\" – even if it is the life of J Robert Oppenheimer, \"The Father of the Atomic Bomb\"? The real subject of Oppenheimer, therefore, is not the life and times of its protagonist, but whether Nolan can enter the subatomic levels of the human psyche. In other words, do we know more about Oppenheimer coming out than we did going in? The answer is yes and no. On a broad level, yes, we do get to see the various types of education the man put himself through. We get to see him associating with people we have only read about in Physics books: Einstein and Niels Bohr and Enrico Fermi. We see his facility with learning languages: he even reads Sanskrit, in the only cinematic instance of the Bhagavad Gita being used in a bedroom scene. We see his Left-leaning tendencies, even if he does not officially join the Communist party. We see him with a wife, a lover – both very tragically underwritten. And we see Oppenheimer being questioned, after the “success” of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, about his allegiance to America. What we don’t see is a distinct directorial vision. Let me explain this with a spectacular early stretch from Interstellar, when the protagonist leaves his family to fly off into space. It’s a super-intense stretch, and you really feel the bigness of the emotion on a big IMAX screen. The screaming, weeping daughter runs out, only to be greeted by the dust raised by her father’s speeding car. She cannot see him. Then we get the other point-of-view shot, from the side of the car – this time, the clouds of dust obscure the father’s view of his house and his family. The collected, composed nature of the grandfather and brother is contrasted with the emotional nature of father and daughter. And over the tear-filled father’s face, we get one of Nolan’s most effective instances of playing with time. He fuses the visual of the speeding car with the audio of the countdown – that is, the present and the immediate future – and… boom! The screen is suddenly filled with fire as the rocketship takes off. I remember feeling breathless and knocked out in the theatre. The only time we see this kind of auteur-ial signature in Oppenheimer is during the Trinity test, which was the first time a nuclear device was detonated. Nolan ratchets up the tension almost unbearably in the minutes leading up to the test (there’s another countdown clock here, a wonderfully analog version compared to the digital one in Interstellar) – and when the bomb goes off, there’s just silence. In a film scattered with religious references, this stretch feels almost… sacred. Even if you are not the religious type, I’ll bet you’ll feel something seeing the dreadful mushroom clouds. It’s as though we are both playing God and witnessing the wrath of God. Silence is the only possible soundtrack. And then the thunderous sound hits, and… boom! The implication that humankind has been altered forever is unmistakable. But the rest of the time, Oppenheimer is more dutiful than dazzling, more admirable than awe-inspiring. The most surprising thing about the film is that it feels so much like other, earlier films. The early “he did this, and then he did that” portions feel like any other biopic that ticks off the protagonist’s traits and achievements. The big hearings feel like the portions of The Godfather: Part II where Michael Corelone is under trial. And amidst this, the most important aspect of Oppenheimer never comes through. We are told about his guilt in creating this genocidal weapon, but we never feel the weight of this guilt – because the film is always in a hurry to rush to the next bit of exposition, the next stretch of talk. (And trust me, there is a lot of talk.) There is no stay on any single emotion. The talking is all on the outside, but what we really needed to hear is Oppenheimer’s inner voice. Oppenheimer is certainly a watchable film. There’s a great cast including Matt Damon, Kenneth Branagh, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, a fabulous Gary Oldman, and of course, Cillian Murphy, who does more for the character than the writing does for him. Also, Nolan does his patented “time thing” – both screenplay-wise and editing-wise – to keep things moving at express speed. Let’s take the part where Oppenheimer meets an army officer named Pash, played by Casey Affleck. We get three timelines: the present, where Oppenheimer meets Pash; the immediate future where the Matt Damon character asks Oppenheimer about this meeting with Pash; and the far future, where this meeting with Pash is discussed in front of the interrogating committee. So yes, the talkiness of the film never makes it “boring”. But there’s also a feeling of things being very generic, especially in the way the “real villain” is exposed at the end. It feels right out of a cheap melodrama. The Florence Pugh character, whom Oppenheimer has an affair with, never feels like she’s fully there. And so when he grieves the end of the relationship, the grief does not pierce us. Emily Blunt plays Oppenheimer’s wife as a stern, strong woman whose early scenes with her infant are entirely stripped of dramatic potential, and even in her later scenes of being a pillar of support, she comes across more like a placeholder than a person. Oppenheimer’s brother, similarly, is spoken about as being central to his life, but the man barely registers. The best biopics in recent times – Lincoln, Steve Jobs –  were highly focused, and with a few events, we broke into the psyche of the subjects. Oppenheimer crams in so much that it is diffuse to the point of seeming vaporous. The more we see of the man, the less we seem to really know him. Early on, we seem to be in the “troubled genius” biopic mode. Eventually, we end up with the biopic of a modern-day Jesus Christ, nailed on a cross for being an anti-war martyr. Oppenheimer’s wife keeps asking him to fight back, and you feel her frustration. But this is also the easiest way to earn the audience’s sympathy. Had Oppenheimer fought back, had he been more complex, we may not have “liked” him so much – and for all the technical/screenwriting complexity that marks Nolan;’s work, he’s never been one for psychological complexity. I liked Nolan’s decision to show things mainly from his protagonist’s point of view. So we never see the Hiroshima/Nagasaki bombings. We hear of them over the radio, like Oppenheimer does. We don’t see images of what happened to the Japanese in these cities in the days after the war. We either hear about the horrible after-effects, or see them imagined through Oppenheimer’s eyes, as he’s hit by visions while doing regular things like addressing an audience. But as if to compensate, every little thing Oppenheimer hears is supplemented by a visual that lasts a fraction of a second. For instance, if we hear about a bomb blast in Halifax, the screen micro-cuts to fragments of an explosion before we cut back to the talking that’s going on about the bomb blast in Halifax. It’s as though the non-stop information dump isn’t keeping the movie busy enough, and Nolan felt we needed the occasional Nolan-esque visuals to keep his fans interested. Speaking of Nolan-esque, there’s also the non-stop music. And I really couldn’t see why this film needed to be shot in IMAX, or why the fussy back and forth between colour and black-and-white was needed.  Yes, a lot of these decisions have been “pre-sold” and explained to us through interviews and promos, but do they feel true to us while we watch it? That’s the question. I am not a fan of Tenet, but at least it felt like the distinctive work of a very distinctive filmmaker. It had scope. It was wildly ambitious. Oppenheimer feels so bland in comparison, though it is – overall – the better film. At least, it is clean, one of a piece. It doesn’t trip over itself trying to be “clever”. But when David Lean made Lawrence of Arabia, which ran 30 minutes more than this three-hour film, it felt like we were inside the man’s molecules. With Oppenheimer, we feel like we are watching the man through a telescope, or getting a grasp of him by skimming through a Wikipedia page. He looms large on the screen, as though you can reach out and touch him. And yet he feels so distant.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"We are back on Pandora. We move through blue mists. We soar past the flying mountains we know from the earlier film. We enter the forest with winged creatures as sunlight falls in shafts, filtered by the thick flora. And then Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) opens his mouth and brings us crashing down to earth. He says, \"The forests of Pandora have many dangers, but the biggest danger is that you may grow to love her too much.\" And we instantly are reminded of both the pluses and minuses of the first Avatar. I wrote then: \"The visuals are expectedly eye-popping, especially in 3-D, but couldn’t they have diverted a few more dollars towards the script?\" I'd say the same about Avatar 2: The Way of the Water. It's a great theme-park ride. As a movie, though, it makes you want to have a long interview with James Cameron about his big psychological shift from muscular action filmmaker to New Age-y, touchy-feely, digital world-builder. There are many directors who have had a great run of consistently great films. Francis Ford Coppola comes to mind. Between 1972 and 1979, he made The Godfather, The Conversation, The Godfather Part 2, and the magnificent Apocalypse Now, which was an IMAX movie before IMAX was invented. James Cameron is another. He made The Terminator in 1984. He followed it up with Aliens, Abyss, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, and True Lies, in 1994. He proved himself a pitiless manipulator of our senses. He made the action sing like poetry. And then, something happened. He made The Titanic, and though the disaster sequences were epic, the love story exposed his weaknesses in dramatic writing. He's never really recovered. For all the complicated CGI work on Avatar 2, there isn't a single suspenseful sequence like the one in, say, Aliens, where the Sigourney Weaver character enters the lair of the mother alien. There, you held your breath. Here, you just keep thinking that it's breathtaking. The story of Avatar 2 makes little practical sense. For a former marine, Jake Sully does not seem to anticipate the return of the villains from Part 1. He does not equip his tribe with weapons or training in anticipation of that possibility. When he goes into hiding with a colony of sea people – this is when the screen turns into a gorgeous aquarium – he does not seem to realise that he is bringing his war to these innocents. There are two action scenes with identical events of kids being captured – though I must say that the second action sequence is brilliantly shot, CGI-ed, and edited. It is a long, long stretch and it is the one place where we see flashes of the genius James Cameron used to be. Based on the Avatar films, Cameron is certainly a visionary. He is taking movie technology to new places, and future filmmakers will no doubt owe a big debt to Cameron's efforts. But in the present, while inside the IMAX theatre, all I could think was this: my eyes are being entertained, my heart and mind not so much. Actors like Kate Winslet and Sigourney Weaver are given little to do. There are quite a few subplots with immense possibility for emotion: the troubled relationship between a father and son, the eco-bonding of a young girl with Nature, or the wonderfully strange friendship between a boy and a whale-like creature. But none of this is developed and when a major character dies at the end, it feels like an extension of a theme-park ride rather than a shattering loss. Think of the mother-child bond that animated Aliens, or the father-son shadow that loomed over Terminator2: Judgment Day… No, actually, it's better not to think about all that. Still, the answer to the 'should you watch it?' question is a no-brainer. You should, and on the biggest possible screen. But for hard-core James Cameron fans, you should also be prepared for confirmation that one of the greatest pure-action filmmakers of all time has been snatched away from us.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"It's a cause for much joy when a filmmaker known for his penchant for science fiction offers visual callbacks to iconic films in the genre in the opening moments of his latest, Dune: Part Two. Based on the books by Frank Herbert, Part Two, which picks up from Dune: Part One, begins with a voiceover belonging to Florence Pugh that sounds eerily similar to Linda Hamilton's in the Terminator films. The accompanying image of bodies burnt, too, recalls James Cameron's dystopian nightmare. The subsequent image of an embryo is reminiscent of the final image from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. I began thinking of how death and birth (or rebirth) become a recurring theme in Part Two.    Villeneuve alternates these two events inventively at different junctures in this sequel, which boasts more characters and a richer, more majestic scale than its predecessor. There is a supposedly poisonous drink called the 'Water of Life' that 'kills' and rejuvenates (rebirth) at once. Take Timothee Chalamet's Paul Atreides, destined to be the eventual messianic figure known as Kwisatz Haderach or Muad'Dib (among other names). The once-vulnerable young boy undergoes a gradual transformation into an authoritative figure looked at as 'The One' who will lead the good guys to salvation. The same death-rebirth process occurs to his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), also evolving into a more chilling, commanding force later. The drink offers enhancement of visions to someone already blessed with the power of foreseeing future events or reading someone's history merely by looking at them.   Film critic Richard Brody recently tweeted, in response to an interview of Villeneuve where he said he hates dialogue, that the gifted Quebec filmmaker doesn't know how to film them. While disagreeing with Brody that this doesnt apply to all films of Villeneuve, I must point out that it was a glaring shortcoming of Dune: Part One, in which the characters were whispering their lines most of the time, to a point that got me annoyed and, almost put me to sleep. While Part Two doesnt get saved from banal, lifeless dialogues whenever it pauses between high-octane action, it does a relatively better job of holding our attention because, among its various merits, are Zendayas emotionally affecting performance and Javier Bardems successful deadpan comical timing.    Part Two is also, fortunately, much more imaginative at staging a giant spectacle. The design of inanimate objects draws evident comparison to insects. The sequel re-introduces us to a few of the machines from Part One, apart from introducing newer and bigger ones. Suffice it to say that the film is a sci-fi/fantasy fans dream come true. Villeneuve and the extraordinary imagination of cinematographer Greig Fraser once again reinforce the impression of human beings appearing dwarfed in relation to their internal and external environments. In one scene, assassins drop dead like flies from a cliff. In another, armies gathering for a massive battle resemble ants while a shiny globe-looking spacecraft emanating flames levitates in the distance.  Part Two is Villeneuve channelling his inner Ridley Scott. Like the latters recent Napoleon, we see Villeneuve delivering, by far, his biggest epic. The brown-grey-black colour palette may get tiresome for some -- you can only do so much in the desert -- but Villeneuve, Fraser, production designer Patrice Vermette and visual effects artist Paul Lambert paint in broad strokes with limited colours. The result is minimalist yet staggering. Take a gladiatorial match which showcases the slithery, ghostly menace of the films scene-stealing principal villain, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, played by Austin Butler. The entire sequence is a black-and-white dream, unlike anything Ive seen before, its immensity and grandeur matched by anything in Tron: Legacy or The Tragedy of Macbeth.   I must bring up Terminator and 2001 again because, looking at the Dune films in their entirety, you see Villeneuve trying to merge the sensibilities of the Cameron and the Kubrick films, not always a harmonious combination. Part One, which seemed like an action epic by Terrence Malick, had a soporific quality that worked against it in some places. Such moments are fewer in Part Two. The other strange aspect working against it -- and this is no fault of Villeneuve -- is the strong sense of deja vu it evokes. We saw the story of the \"chosen one\" who may or may not get seduced by a dark path, prophecies, or the fear in ones power explored better in other sci-fi/fantasy epics such as The Matrix trilogy or the George Lucas-directed Star Wars. Or what about the outsider trying to be one of a rebel group? (as in Lawrence of Arabia) Or what about the hero trying to tame a giant creature, which later becomes a mode of transport for the characters? (Avatar, which draws heavily from Herberts novel). Villeneuves mammoth challenge involves making us aware of the intricacies and minutiae of Dunes immense world-building and focusing on its characters simultaneously. Its an undertaking that Villeneuve pulls off wonderfully, even if not entirely satisfactory. Some motivations remain unclear; the drastic plot development in a couple of instances might find a better explanation in the books. Part Two ends with a hint at a holy war likely to be explored in Part Three, which I cant wait to see.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\" Alex Garland's films have often elicited strange and polarising reactions. Civil War is no different. It is, by far, the biggest film he has done in terms of scale, but his films, no matter how minimal they look, have, under their surface, explored complex themes and emotions. Now, for an Indian viewer, the events presented on the screen may not seem relatable at first glance, but look closer, and you will see some elements bearing a close resemblance to what's happening in our own country.   Take the entire segment with an unnervingly menacing and intimidating Jesse Plemons, who asks Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Maura, and Cailee Spaeny where they are from in America to ascertain \"How American\" they are. Now, that sounds quite similar to being asked, \"How Indian are you?\" sometimes by the so-called \"patriotic\" folks who live in Dubai or the U.S.   From beginning to end, the film is a rollercoaster ride, with a pall of gloom following each individual -- right from Kirsten Dunst's character: a disillusioned and battle-weary photographer who has seen and been in the most tragic and trauma-inducing circumstances. So when she crosses paths with Cailee Spaeny's character, she sees her younger self in her, with the same enthusiasm and cockiness that she probably felt once.   Speaking of the film's point of view, different people will have different takes on this, but I felt it belongs to Kirsten Dunst's character, and its feelings mirror hers. This is one of those films that isn't interested in spelling everything out for the viewers.   For example, when the film begins, something terrible has happened, and the United States is in the middle of a civil war. There's no explanation given as to how and why it happened. We see a military outfit called Western Forces engaged in conflict with the U.S. government military. Perhaps this is a rogue outfit like the one we saw in the Michael Bay movie, The Rock. We are planted in the middle of the chaos, but the film is sensible enough to respect the audience's intelligence and wants us to put together all the pieces of the puzzle, provided we get all of it.   Take the situation where two snipers are engaged in eliminating an opponent holed up inside a home. Their immediate concern is survival, not politics. This situation speaks about something. There's another instance where a shopkeeper casually reads a book without being bothered about what happens on the outside. The film is probably telling us to get out there and do something about the very problem that concerns us instead of complaining about it on social media.   The film also seems to be saying something about the nature of spectacle and how we see it, and the way Alex Garland treats spectacle and violence is interesting. At times, it panders to blockbuster movie buffs and at others, it dilutes the intensity of the action, as though it wants to deprive the former of the fun and joy they get out of it.   Again, without spelling anything out, it invites us to ask questions about these things. Some of the scenes involving photojournalists remind us of the attitude of those who record an event with their camera without bothering to get involved or help the suffering or the sensation-hungry news organisations whose only concern is to get a quote, with no regard for the well-being of the person giving it.     All this unglamorous mayhem plays out on a large, immersive canvas that makes you feel the unease the characters feel at any moment. The efficient sound design is a combination of choices that either impart a hypnotic quality to the proceedings through some esoteric song choices or use complete silence and ambient noises to build tension.   I found this to be a thought-provoking exercise in the same vein as, say, Jonathan Glazer's The Zone of Interest. Both films rely mainly on images to tell its story. Naturally, this approach is going to frustrate some, and runs the risk of being labelled pretentious by certain groups, but the films that do that are the most interesting, wouldn't you agree?\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\" Rishab Shetty writes, directs, and delivers a joyous and very exuberant performance as Shiva, the protagonist of Kantara – but he's absent from the opening stretch that is set in the nineteenth century. We hear a tale about a king who had everything. He had the love of his family. He had the love of his subjects. What he did not have was peace of mind. There's a second time period, in the mid-1970s, and a third, in 1990. The screenplay uses many devices to tie the past and the present – or rather, to bring the past to the present and show how the two are always intertwined. There's the sound of anklets heard in a forest. There's a near-mythical sword passed on from the days of the king to the days we find Shiva in. There's the reference to Vishnu's third incarnation, Varaha Avatar, where the god became a boar. And the most important past-present connection is a fearsome scream, which is also a metaphor for the cry of anguish of the landless. We hear this cry in the present-day Bhoota Kola performances, and we get into the meat of the plot: Who \"owns\" the forests? Or to extend this point, who owns Nature? The tribals who have lived in these lands for centuries? The government, which draws boundaries and creates forest reserves and wants to relocate these tribals? Or the local landlords, who still think that their ancestors gave away these lands, and so these lands are – in a sense – still theirs? Attached to this supertext is the subtext of whether we can really reject our identity. This question is posed through Shiva, who hails from a family of Bhoota Kola performers, but refuses to have anything to do with the folk-art form. It has something to do with his nightmares, which he must learn to face. Meanwhile, he is content getting a \"mass\" entry as a Kambala champion, a man who wins buffalo races. Kantara follows the classic template of The Chosen One, a man who appears ordinary but is destined for greatness. At first, Shiva is as ordinary as ordinary can be. He drinks. He hunts. He pinches a girl's hip and peeps when she's bathing. He's called a \"fighter cock\", and he is constantly cursed by his mother. And like every self-respecting masala-movie hero, he locks horns with the antagonist, the man who will not allow him to do the things he likes to do. This man is the forest officer Murali, nicely played with gruff authority by Kishore. He represents the System, the government, and at least in one respect, he's the opposite of Shiva: this man does things by the rulebook. The third vertex in this male-triangle movie is the landlord played by Achyuth Kumar. He always wears white, and his heart appears equally spotless, equally pure. But note his name: Devendra. It's a lordly name. It refers to the Vedic god, Indra – as opposed to the more pagan god we see being worshipped by the tribals. There’s a bit of discrimination right there. In short, we are either in a masala movie disguised as folklore, or in folklore disguised as a masala movie. Either way, everything has a touch of symbolism. When Murali interferes with a Bhoota Kola performance, it's also the government interfering in the centuries-old life and customs of tribals. When a tree falls on a Jeep, it almost seems like the forest is avenging itself on behalf of its people. And when the king's sword returns in the story, we recall a promise being made and what would happen when it is broken. All of this is richly shot by Arvind S Kashyap, and elevated by B Ajaneesh Loknath's score, which is simultaneously as big as rock music and as subtle as the gently rippling notes at the film's opening. And some of the action choreography is superb. There are issues in the writing. The portions of Leela (Sapthami Gowda) falling for Shiva should have been better. There's a taken-for-granted quality about this love story. And though Kantara is not exactly a whodunit, the villains are easy enough to spot from a mile away, and a character's change of heart is entirely expected – meaning, the narrative could have used a lot more tension. And in such a story, I wish they'd avoided the cliches – like Shiva bursting in fury when his mother is slapped around, or the really cheap shot of a little girl being killed. But the bigger picture of Kantara is in the smaller details. It’s in the way Leela is torn between her affiliation to her job, i.e. the government, and her people, i.e. the tribals. It's in the way Nature is manifested as wild animals, as forests, as fire, as rain. When Shiva is drenched in a downpour, he says he isn't wet; he has been cleansed. It’s almost like Nature has performed a ritual on him. Despite the generic nature of the middle portions, the closing stretch complements the film’s opening beautifully. And there’s very little more potent than the rush of myth.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\" Balki's Chup begins in classic serial killer-thriller fashion. On a rainy night, a gruesome murder is discovered. The victim is a film critic. There are knife slashes all over his body, and on his head, as is later discovered, there's a star – as in, a star rating. So we have a novel signature: a man (or woman) who targets film critics and carves star ratings on them. Sunny Deol plays Arvind, the cop on the case, and he cracks the script's cleverest aspect: the reason behind each of these bodies being mutilated the way they are. It's delightfully perverse. This alone would have made for a cracker of a cat-and-mouse thriller, but Balki (who co-wrote the screenplay with Rishi Virmani and former critic Raja Sen) has other ideas. He introduces a parallel track: the romance between Dulquer Salmaan's Danny and Shreya Dhanwanthary's Nila/Neela. \"Nila\" is Tamil for moon. \"Neela\" is the name of the heroine of Nayakan. Saranya Ponvannan, the heroine of Nayakan, plays this heroine's mother. Could there be a more \"Balki\" touch?   Film references abound in this gorgeously morbid love letter to cinema. It’s “gorgeous” because Vishal Sinha’s superb cinematography gives us both the rapturous colours of romance, thanks to Danny’s flower shop, as well as the matter-of-fact tone of a procedural. And it’s “morbid” (in a good way) because movie-love is taken to its extreme. When Danny gifts Nila a bouquet of paper flowers, it's a nod to Guru Dutt's Kaagaz Ke Phool, which means… paper flowers. Even the famous shaft lighting from that film is recreated, and it leads to the film's central conceit. Who's the real killer? The one who is actually doing the killings? Or the film critic, who mercilessly \"kills\" a film like Kaagaz Ke Phool with a bad review, and in the process, \"kills\" the filmmaker's career? But on the other hand, Amitabh Bachchan, in a cameo, says, \"Critiquing is a must for society.\" He is kinda-sorta saying what Malcolm X said: “If you have no critics, you’ll likely have no success.”   The serial killer knows this. He or she is not against criticism, per se. They are only against those critics who fake reviews with false star ratings, or trash films in unkind language. I think what Balki (along with the serial killer) is saying is this: Criticise all you like, but do it honestly, ethically, responsibly. This may be the closest this director has come to a “message movie,” and also the closest he’s come to showcasing his all-out, arms-outstretched love for cinema. There is practically no background score except for the temple blocks sound that punctuated Jane kya tune kahi, from Pyaasa. The heroine is film-crazy, too. How does she know she’s in love? When someone comes running towards her, in slow motion. Danny is a florist, and his tulips inspire her to hum that famous tulip-filled song from Silsila.  The film’s most controversial statement is a poster in Nila’s house that says “Woody Allen is innocent,” which could be extrapolated to the art being separate from the artist.    Dulquer is cast against type, and it works brilliantly. He’s alternately melancholic, romantic, moody, awkward, weird – and all these emotions play off nicely against Shreya’s girl-next-door charm. They seem mismatched in most ways, but their abundant love for cinema (which may be greater than their love for each other) brings them together. Against this pair, we have Sunny Deol. It’s a great comeback, and he’s super-effective as a cop who’s about as romantic as a pack of cards. The one big name in the cast that did not work for me was Pooja Bhatt, who plays a criminal psychologist who specialises in psychopaths. With Sunny’s character doing most of the crime-solving work, this role seems redundant. By the time she makes an appearance, we have almost all the information we need. Maybe the character should have been worked into the screenplay earlier. Only in the last portions does the film falter. These are the “explanation” portions, something like the ending of Hitchcock’s Psycho, and they seem rushed. Or put another way, perhaps these portions would not have seemed so rushed had we seen more of this side of the killer earlier. The decision to separate the investigation and the romance is a clever idea, but perhaps there’s too much separation – a little more intertwining of these threads, a few more clues scattered earlier, may have made the two-track narrative more one-of-a-piece. I am not asking for that cat-and-mouse game – just a little more interplay between the cop and the killer. Anyway, I cannot say any more. And this final stretch apart, Chup is an entertaining, engaging and cautionary meta-tale about how words matter, and why criticism is not just about writing witty prose or awarding stars. It’s a serious affair, as serious as cinema. You could say, it’s a matter of… life and death.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"Season 1 of Delhi Crime was about the gang rape case of 2012, which occurred in Delhi. But it was equally about what it's like to be a police officer. DCP Vartika, played by Shefali Shah, says these words: \"One third of Delhi's population lives in unauthorised slums and serves the elite, who earn the highest per capita income in India. Policing a city like this one is a complex task…\" In other words, Season 2 is more of the same. You have to face the media, which will do anything for ratings, including the reveal of footage being used in an investigation. You have to face the public, which sometimes wants vigilante justice ASAP. You have to face your higher-ups, who say impossible things like \"I want an answer in 24 hours\". But most of all, you have to face your family, the one that rarely sees your face.  One of the most striking images in Season 2 is that of the Rasika Dugal character telling her husband that his breakfast is ready, while in uniform. As for Vartika, she faces a daughter who thinks she is controlling and yet is proud of her achievements. Rajesh Tailang wants to get his daughter married off, and is looking for ways to kickstart the process behind her back. It's a testament to this excellent cast – right down to the junior artists and guest stars like Tilottama Shome – that we care deeply about every single one of them. A cop in Vartika's team thinks she is leaving them and begins to make a speech about how she has always treated them like family. The scene is a joke and we laugh, but we also get how sincere and how grateful the cop was. You'd be sincere and grateful, too, if your work family was this supportive, almost making up for the family you leave behind for hours and days at a stretch. The first image of Season 2 is that of Vartika's face. She's in her car, and the composed authority we usually see is replaced by a defeated expression. She looks as though she's seen a ghost. As great as the other actors are – especially Rasika Dugal and Rajesh Tailang – the face of Delhi Crime is the face of Shefali Shah. It's the quiet assurance when she tells the daughter of a brutally murdered couple, \"You don't want to see their faces. That is not the last memory you want to carry with you.\" It's the way she gently but forcefully puts a bigot in his place. (This man is a former cop and he has been summoned for help with a case.) It's the way she receives the big news at the end, which makes us wonder what Season 3 will look like.  Tanuj Chopra is the director, and over five episodes, he and his writers expertly take us through the investigation of a series of murders in upscale neighbourhoods. Along with a ton of procedural detail – I was reminded of Rajeev Ravi's recent Malayalam movie, the excellent Kuttavum Shikshayum – we get to look at the case from a ton of angles. Take this breakfast conversation between Vartika and her husband. He says Delhi has only x number of policemen per lakh of people, and it sounds like a bit of \"look we did all this research\" fact-dropping. But the writing instantly fills this dry fact with emotion that reveals a facet of personality. When he adds that Vartika, therefore, cannot solve each crime, she replies, \"Even if I stop one crime, it's worth it.\" Or take this exchange with Bhupinder, the Rajesh Tailang character. Vartika asks him a rhetorical question. What are we doing wrong? Why isn't the crime rate decreasing? The ever-practical Bhupinder turns this bit of existential hand-wringing into dry fact. \"Well, where is the time to think about this? Even before we begin thinking, another crime happens.\" These slow detours flesh out the inevitable race-against-time aspects of the series. And the detours are not always about these cops. It is also about the city and its people, like the denotified tribes that come under suspect. There's a moral dimension here. The entire group is under suspicion just because they are underprivileged. As a lawyer asks, \"During the Harshad Mehta scam, was everyone named Mehta thrown into jail?\" The language, too, adds to the authenticity. Unlike Hindi films, Delhi Crime uses the mix of Hindi and English beautifully. \"I am very sorry to put you through this but beta aapne jo bataya it's going to be a great help to the case.\" Or, \"Yeh jo CCTV footage leak hua hai it's a very serious matter.\" The lines sound so clean and organic. There are very few flaws, but if I had to nitpick, I'd point to the scene where Vartika says that there are no \"born criminals\". This claim comes full circle at the end, when we get a psychological explanation for the crime from the criminal. But it feels too pat, too reductive for a show as complex as this one. (Maybe I wouldn't have felt this way if this had played out over a longer stretch of time.) Also, the gut-wrenching impact of Season 1 is missing, but that cannot be helped. The Nirbhaya case was so primally disturbing that its aftermath encompassed a nation. The crime here is more of a kind with Hollywood genre pieces. But like I said, this is just nitpicking. Season 2 of Delhi Crime is a worthy addition to one of the finest shows – not just on Indian television but anywhere.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\" If Martin Scorsese and Timothy Dalton's James Bond had a baby, it would be something like Vikram. This is a drug-filled gangster movie, filled wall-to-wall with fantastic rock-music riffs, courtesy Anirudh. This is a grim saga about secret agents who sacrifice a great deal to save the world, paying a high personal cost. This is also Lokesh kanagaraj's purest movie to date. During Master, there was talk about the film being 50% Vijay, 50% Lokesh Kanagaraj. Vikram is 100% Lokesh, while also being a 100% Kamal Haasan movie. It is not just about the fanboy, easter-egg references like the name Stephen Raj (Vetri Vizha) or Prabanjan (Kamal Haasan's writer-friend) or the umbrella shot from Sathya or the play on the most famous lines from Nayakan and Kuruthipunal. It is also that fantastic monologue about evolution, which seems plucked right out of Kamal Haasan's screenwriting / dialogue-writing brain. The spirit of Kamal Haasan hovers over the film like a… Ghost. Vikram runs close to three hours and yet, there is very little flab. The half-hearted romance of Maanagaram - that's not there. The prolonged \"family-friendly\" daughter sentiment from Kaithi - that's not there. The hero-buildup college scenes from Master - that's not there. Lokesh seems to have finally made exactly the movie he wanted to make - and he has Kamal Haasan to thank for that. This is an action movie – the first real genre-specific action film of Tamil cinema, where even the hero-introduction song (Pathala pathala) becomes a small part of the larger scheme of things (It finds context later in the narrative). The sentimental moments don't kill the flow of the genre because they are not hammered home with \"scenes\". They are folded into the narrative in little bits. Plus, you get all the emotion you need from Kamal's eyes or from Fahadh Faasil's sly body language. Fahadh is fantastic – he manages the considerable feat of almost stealing a Kamal movie. At first, we seem to be watching a story about the hunt for masked murderers. But gradually, we see this is about something bigger. Lokesh does not make the mistake of moralising. He simply want us to feel what the stakes are if the good guys fail – and he lets us know that these bad guys really mean business. (There is a lot of collateral damage.) The screenplay demands close attention – there's quite a bit of parallel narration. For example, we get a wife in danger and baby in danger – and we keep switching between the two tracks. It builds slowly and meticulously, adding micro-detail after micro-detail to a police procedural conducted by rogue cops, headed by the Fahadh character. And it cuts loose after the sensational interval block, becoming a full-fledged treat for action lovers, especially 80s/90s Hollywood action lovers. Anbariv is the action director. He stages the stunts in short bursts, and he uses tight spaces (corridors, stairways) very well. The devil is in the details. When a van hits a bike, the shot feels thrillingly real – which means that the cinematographer Girish Gangadharan and editor Philomin Raj have captured and cut this collision at exactly the right angle and speed. We also get more showy stretches, like the one where the camera thrusts in and out of the space where a masked man fights a number of enemies. Is Lokesh Kanagaraj building his own universe: the \"LKU\"? Because we have guns: small guns, bigger guns, and really big guns. We have characters from an orphanage. We have the endless nights – and some excellent night-scene choreography. And we have characters and the drug consignment from Kaidhi, which lead to a fantastic cameo by Suriya. This is the most electric the actor has been in years. You see in his eyes the madness you should have seen in NGK. There is not one bad performance in the bunch, and the writing adds lovely touches like Chemban Vinod Jose checking in on his bedridden father or a surprisingly agile domestic help or a gun-filled scene with Vijay Sethupathi and one of his wives. The dialogues, too, are simple and super-effective – like the lines Gayathrie Shankar utters after a disappointment. The only issue I had with Vikram is with Vijay Sethupathi's villain. He gets a terrific entry scene and is called the \"ullooru Pablo Escobar\" and you expect great things from this character. But the writing is content to leave him a rather generic villain. It is left to the actor to add to the role more colour and flavour with his funky presence. And what about the big man himself? He has a ball. This is a self-aware movie, maybe even a meta-movie at some level. When Fahadh tells Kamal, \"I am a big fan of your work,\" or when Kamal echoes the lyrics of the title song of the earlier Vikram, there is some inevitable winking at the audience. But there is no fourth-wall breaking. The film is all of a piece, perfectly realised and a perfect tribute to a great genre and a great actor. Even when absent from screen, we feel his presence. Vikram is not just a fitting big-screen comeback for Kamal Haasan. Thanks to Lokesh and team, he finally has on his resumé the Vikram he wanted to make 36 years ago.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"Based on a real-life incident, Chidambaram’s Manjummel Boys – set in 2006 – tells the story of a group of friends that went to the Guna caves, where the superhit Ilayaraja song, ‘Kanmani anbodu’ was shot. (Another snatch of a Kamal Haasan-Ilayaraja song, Annatha aadurar, plays en route, in Palani.) One of this group falls into a deep pit, and while the locals say the guy is a goner, the friends refuse to lose faith. They came as a group. They will leave as a group. This is, thus, as much a survival drama as the story of undying friendship. The film can be compared to that other smash-hit survival drama, 2018. It is written in very broad strokes. For instance, it is not enough that a man is trapped in a pit. We also get horror stories about local beliefs about the pit, nicknamed Devil’s Kitchen. These stories are necessary – but they are not narrated casually. They are shot in an ultra-dramatic manner that hammers home extra layers of the dangers involved. It’s not enough that the shell-shocked friends rush to a police station for help. There has to be a cop in there who brandishes a stick and threatens to file an FIR on them for killing their friend and trying to pass the act off as an accident. Sushin Shyam’s unabashedly big score – solo violin and all – underlines the bigness of the telling. There are many individual moments that work. Soubin Shahir plays Kuttan, one of the oldest men in the group. As he descends into the jagged pit, we see how dangerous the fall must have been for the man who fell. There is an exquisitely poetic stretch that shows the friends as young boys playing hide-and-seek, which is the very “game” that will later be played out at the Guna cave. As the young boys play, the sunlit, bright-yellow frames of Manjummel transform to the chilly blues of Kodaikanal. The reason this stretch works so well is that it points to two things: one, the fact that someone is always getting into trouble and the others have to help him out, and two, we get a psychological portrait of a dream state. But when the second childhood flashback occurs, it’s redundant. It feels like the film is being padded out. In other words, we get a lot of uneven writing – but the “high” moments deliver such a high that most people may not care about what doesn’t work. I didn’t care for the frequent cutaways to the larger rock formations and hills. While these images reinforce the bigness of Nature (and our smallness in comparison), and also reinforce how dangerous this setting is, we keep getting distanced from the claustrophobia of the cave-situation.  The sentimental ending, too, goes on and on, much after the rescue, to hammer home the heroic nature of the hero. It is not enough that the man does a heroic deed – until the entire township acknowledges it and celebrates it. But the real heroes of the film are production designer Ajayan Chalissery and cinematographer Shyju Khalid. You don’t know where the sets end and where the real settings take over. And the visuals have just the balance of docu-drama and cinematic drama. If the idea was to convey the fact that “this really happened”, then mission accomplished. The screenplay is always playing to the audience. It believes in big, very obvious set-ups – as opposed to the smaller, more invisible set-ups in, say, Premalu, that have unexpected payoffs, like the bit about the pepper spray. And these big set-ups in Manjummel Boys are calculated to make you anticipate the payoffs – as opposed to the payoffs taking us by surprise. A man sees a piece of news in a torn bit of a newspaper, and his face fills up with an expression that makes the audience go: “What on earth did he read in that bit of newspaper!” And the pay-off happens at the end. Another set-up involves a very pointed conversation about God, who is described as a “light from above”. And we get this very image – a light from above – as a payoff. Why not have a more rambling conversation amongst all the friends, a conversation that happens to include God – as opposed to a two-line exchange that is specifically about God as a set-up, and that too with the very person who is going to be reminded of God? That way, we’d get more interaction between this bunch, and we’d also get a set-up that’s more… disguised. And why sentimentalise the rescued man as a god, because he has come back from the dead? This is the kind of bad, gallery-pleasing melodrama you expect in Tamil cinema, not Malayalam. But there’s no denying the mechanical efficiency of the end-result of this chain of set-ups and pay-offs. When the “light from above” moment happens, when that goosefleshy tug-of-war moment happens, when very specific lines from the Guna song play at the end of the ordeal (no spoiler there!), it works. It totally works. The rescue operation ends with an image that left me with tears. Soubin Shahir, as always, is marvellous – he has a way of embodying the ordinary with minimal fuss, even when his character is facing the most extraordinary situations. But the other actors don’t register much, because they are presented as a collective with a trait here, a trait there. For instance: at a wedding, Kuttan is the one who serves people their meals. He is the helper, while his friend won’t even serve water because he doesn’t want his clothes to get stained. Sreenath Bhasi plays the reckless one. We instantly know his fate. Because of this pointed “one trait per person” writing, the interpersonal relationships don’t come across well, and I was reminded of Sudani from Nigeria, where the bromance elements were far more convincing, far more moving. I wondered if – for narrative clarity alone – the number of people in the group could have been reduced. Because at least half this group ends up contributing very little to the proceedings. The most moving portion involving this group is the subtext. These are very ordinary men in very ordinary jobs. They are house painters, cab drivers, assistants in optometrist shops – they are single, and these occasional trips are the highlights of their lives. The inclusion of the Guna song, is thus, a masterstroke. It’s not just that the song was shot in the location where most of this movie takes place. It’s also that the all-consuming, almost divine flavour of romance in the song applies to this all-consuming, almost divine bromance between these men. That is why – despite its many flaws – Manjummel Boys works. I saw the film as a larger metaphor for the Malayalam film industry, whose movies have the longest “thank you card” stretches in Indian cinema. Unlike in other industries, where stars and technicians operate on their own, the people working in Malayalam cinema come across like a brotherhood, like their own version of “Manjummel Boys”. In this film alone, we see Khalid Rahman, the director of the gorgeous Anuraga Karikkin Vellam and Thallumaala, Unda and Love. He plays a supporting part, and his brother is this film’s cinematographer. The director of Driving License, Lal Jr., is another supporting actor here. The sense of camaraderie that exists in the Manjummel boys, that seems to exist in the industry, too. And that’s why – whether individual films work or not – the industry as a whole is thriving. That Guna song, perhaps, is an ode to this industry, which comes across as a fraternity in the truest sense of the word.\"\"\"\n",

Reviews: \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\t1. One week ago, had you asked me for my pick for Screenplay of the Year-so-far, it would have hands-down been Gireesh AD’s Premalu. But now, after watching the brilliantly done Aavesham, it’s a tie. Like Gireesh, Jithu Madhavan doesn’t seem to be a fan of “plot”. He prefers to put his efforts into his characters and his writing, and Aavesham comes off like an extension of his first film, Romancham. There, a few men find themselves unleashing a spirit, an impulsive act that backfires on them. Here, a few men find themselves unleashing a gangster named Ranga – and this impulsive act, again, backfires on them. Like the ghost in Romancham, Ranga – played by Fahadh Faasil – is practically an other-worldly character. He wears spotless white. He has some ten kilos of gold on his body, in the form of rings and chains. His black handlebar moustache is complemented by his black aviator glasses. He’s multilingual, speaking Kannada and Malayalam and Hindi. He’s also one of the greatest characters ever written for the screen. On the surface, there might be this tendency to use the word “mass” for him – because he gets a lot of highlight moments befitting a mass hero that make the theatre explode. But Ranga is more. Watch him do a towel-dance after a bath, and then watch him in a fight. He doesn’t actually fight. Like an action choreographer, he asks his goons to break this guy’s arm and that guy’s leg. The magic in the writing of this character is twofold. One, it keeps us guessing whether this man is a criminal or a cartoon – the payoff at the end is huge. And two, at a subtextual level, Ranga is a spoof of everything that passes for masculinity in our mainstream movies. Jithu Madhavan takes the “good-hearted rowdy” trope and runs with it as though he invented it. And Fahadh returns the favour. The character may be all surface – all that white, all that bling – and it is entirely possible to enjoy Aavesham without taking it seriously at all. But if you dig deep, you will see that – like all good actors – Fahadh takes this cartoon character seriously, and he plays Ranga like he would play a dramatic role, with thought and total commitment and investment. It’s a glorious performance, a combination of Jim Carrey’s rubbery physicality in The Mask and the self-celebration of masculinity that we saw in Fahadh’s own Shammi from Kumbalangi Nights. Fahadh plays with Ranga’s physicality, his tonality. He balances the exaggerations with the more controlled emotions. Fahadh Faasil basically tells all insecure heroes that you don’t have to be in every scene of a movie, and yet, you can be the most unforgettable part of that movie! And how does Ranga come into the picture, in this story set in Bengaluru? Actually, for a long time, he is out of the picture. Aavesham opens in an engineering college, where the life-size model of an aeroplane is kept on display. A mother tells her son – Bibi (Mithun Jai Shankar) – that one day, he should build something similar. In other words, she wants him to soar. But the minute she enrols Bibi in a hostel and leaves, his life takes a different turn. He has two roommates, Aju (Hipzster) and Shanthan (Roshan Shahnavaz). They antagonise a senior named Kutty (Midhutty), and pay the price. They are stripped and beaten up, and then – suddenly – Kutty hands them drinks and calls them his “bros”. (This screenplay is filled with tone changes.) Apparently, every rowdy-like person likes to surround themselves with “bros”. Keep this fact in mind, because it gets a payoff at the end. In the midst of people who stick around only for booze and money, these gangsters seek people who will stick around for love, for friendship. But at the moment, Aju is in no mood to be a “bro”. The three boys are written well, and played well. Shanthan is the one who is happy following the path of least resistance. Bibi is written as someone who isn’t easy to read. His character arc is a beauty. And Aju is the alpha-male of the group. He wants revenge. He looks for a rowdy to beat up Kutty, and that’s how he and his friends find Ranga. Just wait till you see the location of the man’s “hero-introduction scene”. Ranga is at once a celebration of all things macho and a deconstruction of all things macho. There’s a sensational moment where he shows – in a stunning top-angle shot – how every goon in the bar fears him. And yet, watch that mass-hero staple of the slo-mo run being spoofed. Ranga runs in slo-mo, and… you’ll have to see the rest for yourself. Slowly, in trying to befriend Ranga, Aju and Bibi and Shanthan are drawn into his larger-than-life life and his violent actions. You can sense a subtext about being drawn to macho-ness and then being repelled by too much macho-ness – but the film is so light on its feet and so bloody fun that you may not think about any of this until much later. The jokes keep coming like bullets from a machine gun. There’s a revolver that won’t fire. There’s a spoof of the “mother sentiment” so dear to our mainstream movies. The bit woven around a grihapravesham is a riot. And there’s an amazing set piece involving a game of dumb charades, where Fahadh/Ranga goes from grinning clown to scary criminal and back to grinning clown. Sushin Shyam’s wacky score is a perfect accompaniment to the wacky proceedings. Aavesham is in no hurry to tell its story, and that’s why every character, every set piece registers so well. The action stretches are electric, with cinematography by Sameer Thahir and editing by Vivek Harshan. You get the sense of watching a massive circus event at Las Vegas, and the cutting is as smooth as silk. But also consider the dramatic stretches with other characters, who get smaller screen time. Mansoor Ali Khan plays a rowdy. He also plays the archetype for Ranga. He is who Ranga will be in a couple of decades. And Ashish Vidyarthi, as a college big shot, gets a brilliant bit where he proves that you can exude threats and gangster vibes even while wearing a suit. He owns a gun, but his choice of weapon is the English language. But after Ranga, the film’s most lovable character is Amban, the loyal sidekick played beautifully by Sajin Gopu. The man is built like a mountain (it shows especially when he stands next to Fahadh), and yet, he’s like a kid in a candy store. Every opportunity for a fight brings him great delight. Whether he is narrating Ranga’s real or imagined exploits or taking knife cuts on his back, Amban transforms the traditional sidekick character into a violent teddy bear. Not since Munna Bhai and Circuit has a rowdy pair appeared so lovable. On the surface, Aavesham may look like a big dumb action flick that asks you to leave your brains at the door, but actually, it is a very smart combination of action and comedy and drama. I loved every second of it, and I demand a sequel with Amban and Ranga.\\n\\t2. In Amar Singh Chamkila, Imtiaz Ali gives us two films for the price of one. The first – more obvious – narrative follows the shape of a biopic, the life and times of the “Elvis of Punjab”, played by Diljit Dosanjh. That nickname, as we come to see, isn’t just about the massive popularity Chamkila enjoyed in his lifetime. This is the 1980s, and he outsells Amitabh Bachchan in a live show. But here’s the other layer. Just like Elvis was accused of corrupting young America with dance moves resembling those of a male striptease artist and songs whose erotic energy was even wilder, Chamkila was frequently hauled up by cultural gatekeepers for his sexually charged lyrics. Irshad Kamil, who outdoes himself in the soundtrack, writes these words for Chamkila’s detractors: “ganda sa banda hai / social darinda hai”! The rise and fall of a musician who brought joy to the masses, and the question whether art ought to be censored for those very masses – these two layers come together magnificently in this movie. The film opens with much excitement, as Punjab’s most famous Ambassador car is sighted by a wedding party: they have commissioned a music performance by Chamkila and his wife Amarjot, played by Parineeti Chopra. And from then on, Imtiaz (who co-wrote the screenplay with Sajid Ali) and his brilliant editor Aarti Bajaj do their trademark thing. We get small (sometimes micro) scenes that get to the heart of the emotion in a heartbeat, and these small scenes come together like pieces in a colourful quilt. The film uses the assassination of Chamkila and Amarjot as a pivot point, and keeps going back and forth in time. There appear to be many suspects: fundamentalists, militants who rose in influence after Indira Gandhi was shot dead, rival singers, loyalists that Chamkila abandoned along the way – but this is not a lazy “who did it?” murder mystery. The real question is: Who was this man? This decision to talk about Chamkila after his killing gives the sense of the man still being alive after death, as though people could not stop talking about him. It’s like he is very much in the present even after he has become a part of the past. Put simply, it’s the idea of immortality. And the writing and  editing juxtapose faces and events with such nimbleness that we are never in doubt about who is who even though we (at least, those of us unfamiliar with Chamkila) are faced with a host of unknown names and faces. I’ll give you an example. Early on, we see a singer named Jinda in broad daylight, on stage with Chamkila. CUT TO: we get a profile shot of Jinda at night, as he adds his two bits about who Chamkila was, from his point of view. The film, thus, isn’t a definitive portrait. Rather, like a folk story passed on through the oral tradition, it is a collection of these orally narrated points of view that give us different facets and dimensions of a beloved but controversial man. At times, Chamkila himself becomes a narrator of his life. There is a great bit where he sits down to eat and appears displeased that the roti is cold. You think  the scene is about one emotion, but it quickly turns into another – and we get the feeling that perhaps it is not possible to fully know this man. In another brilliant scene, Chamkila’s father shouts at him for cutting his hair and disrespecting Sikhism, but Chamkila calmly hands over a bundle of money and the old man quiets down. As always, money solves all problems. But what were Chamkila’s own feelings about his religion? That we may never get to know. What has survived, what we know for sure, is the music – and AR Rahman hits it out of the park. The soundtrack album is superb, as is the background score. Imtiaz and Rahman fill the narrative with silences, so that we really feel and register the emotion when instruments make themselves heard behind the action: when an acoustic guitar is heard during a conversation outside a police station, when a sitar is heard as Chamkila talks to Amarjot alone for the first time, when a flute and strings are heard when Chamkila confronts another woman in his life, or when a dramatic whiplash is heard when militants enter Chamkila’s home. In a sense, Rahman’s score grows over the course of the film. The first time we see the assassination, it’s in total silence. When the same scenario is replayed at the end, we get a big orchestral score. The first time, the man is a stranger. The second time, we have come to know him to the extent that we can – so the emotion produced by the big score is truly earned. This is the rare movie that does not use its background score as a blunt instrument to pound the audience into emotional submission. There are scenes where we crave to know more about the emotional logic. Why did Chamkila leave the first woman in his life before marrying Amarjot? Why did Chamkila abandon his loyal manager before going to perform in Canada? This unknowability is emphasised with a series of distancing devices. For one, there are the photographs of the real-life Chamkila and Amarjot. Most biopics seek to maintain the illusion that the actors playing the subjects of the story are really the real people – and maybe at the end, over the credits, we may get reminders of those real people. But Imtiaz destroys this notion by constantly going back to pictures of the real Chamkila, the real Amarjot, even as Diljit and Parineeti are playing Chamkila and Amarjot on screen. Amar Singh Chamkila keeps playing with form. Whenever we listen to performances, we hear the songs in Diljit’s and Parineeti’s own voices – so there is no dissonance between the voices they speak in and the voices they sing in. But when an inner emotion is underlined (as opposed to those external performances), we get Rahman’s songs with playback singers like Mohit Chauhan, Arijit Singh, Alka Yagnik, and Jonita Gandhi. The original Punjabi lyrics are maintained in the live shows, but for those of us who don’t know the language we get Hindi equivalents of some lines – but these Hindi words are written in English. (If you are watching the film with subtitles, there is an additional distancing layer, because now you are reading the English equivalents of those lyrics.) Apart from the music, we get split screens designed like two squares on a film strip, we get animation, and when we see love bloom from Amarjot’s point of view, we get flares on the borders of the frames, like those old films where the edges of the camera were blurred out with Vaseline. Sylvester Fonseca is the cinematographer, and this is one of the rare instances we see something flashy. Otherwise, he leads us through the story with the practised casualness of turning the pages of a book. A lot of Amar Singh Chamkila is a familiar story, but the individual scenes and the actors are so good that they reinvent the broad beats – like in the bit where Chamkila and his manager hear a record playing his song and run in search of it. They find the store where the record is being played, and Diljit fingers his moustache with a small smile. He’s proud, but the gesture makes it a muted kind of pride. When he makes a reference to his Dalit roots – “Chamar hoon par bhookha nahin maroonga” – his anger is muted. Even his business sense is muted. When he meets Amarjot, he says he does not need to hear her sing because someone he trusts has vouched for her. The innocence and naïveté in Diljit’s utterly captivating performance makes Chamkila someone you root for all the way, and Parineeti, too, nicely underplays her part. On stage, she keeps looking down, as though she doesn’t want to see audiences looking at her while she is singing those songs. So why did these two people sing those songs? One plausible reason is that Chamkila had no pretences or filters, and he simply wrote the way people spoke, or simply said the things most people thought in private but would not say in public. After all, look at how the DSP speaks to his fawning subordinate: “Itna bhi makhkhan na lagao ki andar haath ghus jaaye.” Look at how women (in the song Naram kaalja) objectify a man’s organ: “Chhoti si aari leke tu kya kaatega jangal.” Look at the lewd lines sung at weddings. Even when Chamkila tries to change his image and make a devotional album (that, too, became a blockbuster), the masses want him to sing the songs that made him a star: because they need to laugh amidst their troubles, and for them, this is a valid form of entertainment. And this is what Chamkila says to a posh, jeans-wearing reporter who says he objectifies women in his songs. He does not deny that he does. But he also says, “Chhote log yehi pasand karte hain…” And by “chhote log”, he means those who are not privileged, he means the masses. The privileged people and the prudes and the conservatives complain – especially after Indira Gandhi’s death – that people are dying, and here this man is singing songs that go: “Jijaji meri kamar ka naap le lo.” Is it… appropriate? But it is at these dark times that people need entertainment, and who is to tell them what the “appropriate” form of entertainment is? Some of the older members in the audience may remember the cultural tug-of-war that erupted when “Choli ke peeche kya hai” became a blockbuster, and when Govinda and Karisma Kapoor nearly dislodged their pelvises gyrating to “Sarkailo lyo khatiya jaada lage.” Both films – Khalnayak and Raja Babu – were blockbusters. In other words, the “chhote log”, the masses lapped them up. It is the same conflict that was explored in Miloš Forman’s, The People vs. Larry Flynt, based on the man who published the pornographic Hustler magazine. If there is such a thing as freedom of expression, then should there be cultural gatekeepers or should people be left to self-censor what they want and don’t want to read or see or hear? Imtiaz does not attempt to answer this question directly, which is how it should be. This question has no definitive answer. It is how each individual responds to the issue so Imtiaz just puts up both sides and leaves it for us to decide. Chamkila says, “Why am I being targeted when other singers sing such songs, too?” Could it be jealousy? Or is it that the most popular one becomes the most sought after when you want to set an example and “do good for society”. But, indirectly, at least, Imtiaz lets us see where his sympathies lie. He is for Chamkila, and against cultural censorship. The film gives us “logical” explanations – for example, that Chamkila’s caste-mentality never really went away, that he remained a “slave” of the audience, giving them what they wanted. Another “logical” explanation we are given is that he has risen from rags to riches, and he cannot return to where he came from. Chamkila tells Amarjot that let’s make money first, “phir aaram se sochenge kya sahi hai aur kya galat.” But “emotionally” speaking, Chamkila comes off like a martyr for a cause, because of the grand eulogy Rahman gifts him: “Vida karo”. The beautifully penned words mask the sarcasm that drips through the song: “Let me go, because a dirty man like me does not deserve to be in your world of pure people.” “Tum sabhi saaf sahi / hoon matmela main…” The moving song breaks your heart, and makes you wonder what art is, and who gets to decide how it is practised or how people choose to entertain themselves. In this age of social media and rampant armchair-activism, Amar Singh Chamkila raises important questions. And yes, it is also a beautiful film.\\n\\t3. Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal plays like Subhash Ghai’s version of The Godfather – and I mean this in a mostly good way. (I’ll add that to see the film this way, you have to be – like me – a lover of pulp and excess.) In the trashy Mario Puzo novel and the classy Coppola adaptation that followed, a son becomes a criminal because of an attack on his father. But what if there was a twist! What if the son already had psychopathic, criminal tendencies! What if he was already a… khalnayak! What if at least some of these criminal tendencies stemmed from the father being distant, which caused an almost pathological longing for daddy-love, which then manifested itself as territorial behaviour! What if the son is essentially telling the world, “If I cannot have a piece of my father, then neither can anyone else, not even the ones who want to kill him”! I use the word “territorial” deliberately. Ranbir Kapoor – who, as Vijay, gives everything he’s got – is the animal of the title, and he sees his father as his… “territory”. A superbly in-form (and in tune with the overheated material) Anil Kapoor plays the father, Balbir Singh. But apart from a few overheated lines, he is reduced to the weakened Don Corleone from The Godfather: a series of pained, pathetic looks at what his son has become. Sandeep recreates many moments from The Godfather, like a car explosion, or the killing of a brother-in-law, or the long opening set piece set during a (birthday) celebration, or the search for the people who attacked the father. And to this, he adds a gleeful pulp sensibility we never saw in Arjun Reddy. The sensational pre-interval fight combines men in “animal” masks, a Kabir doha, and a cheeky made-in-India reference, thanks to an automatic firing machine that acts like the biggest phallus in this movie that’s essentially about overheated men waving their dicks around. At times, Animal plays like a dark comedy. Think of the cheerfully vulgar joke about an “animal” in the opening scene, which involves another phallic object: a sword! The anecdote tells us that we are what we are, and our toxic animal nature cannot be civilised or tamed by love or any other such bullshit. There are several laugh-out-loud moments, like the echo of a joke involving pubic hair, or the overhead shot of two fighting men that resembles two children fighting in school,  or the reveal of the Bobby Deol character occurring as Vijay is finally using sign language after saying he does not want to use sign language. (There is a connection.) If you have “good taste”, do not go near this movie! You may feel like the critic Rex Reed did after watching Brian de Palma’s Scarface: he called it a pointless bloodbath that aimed only to disgust, sicken, and horrify the audience with a rampage of violence, bloodshed, and carnage. It is true that some of this criticism can be applied to Sandeep’s movie. The rampage of violence does get exhausting after a point. After you’ve been through the pre-interval bloodbath, more blood is hardly going to have the same impact. And the second half does lose steam, because it turns into a more conventional “revenge story”, and the psychological aspects get lost amidst all the bloodletting. But where the writer-director scores is in throwing in so many unconventional things into the mix that you can’t tear your eyes away from the screen. There are any number of ways a mole can enter an organisation, but you will never guess the way this scenario occurs in Animal. This requires some truly outrageous imagination that truly thinks larger than life. This quality is the film’s beating heart. That body double – what an idea! After a point, the Mahabharata peeks in, with a war between blood relations. There is even a grand yagna! The women – Rashmika Mandanna as Vijay’s wife, Tripti Dimri as a lover – don”t get much to do. In Arjun Reddy, we followed the protagonist’s point of view throughout. So when the woman left his life, we never saw her until he met her again. (There were no cutaway scenes showing what was happening to her in parallel.) But that is not the case here. Animal is not written from that kind of subjective viewpoint. So we want more from Rashmika’s character than just slapping her husband around, which appears like Sandeep answering his Arjun Reddy critics. She does get a solid scene woven around her husband’s infidelity, but it goes on too long and it does not have the desired impact.  But think about the reference to her child-bearing hips. On the surface, it sounds crass, but that is an evolutionary way of choosing a woman for marriage in the “animal” kingdom. The meaning of the title never leaves the film. It is there in the lines, the behaviours… and even in a brand of underwear. (I told you this was a dark comedy.) The film breaks every storytelling rule. We learn of a killing, and then we learn of the reason behind the killing. This is not intended to create suspense (which is the usual reason), but to create shock, to keep us off-balance. The startling cuts (Sandeep is also the editor) also help. Even rhythm-wise, we are kept off-balance. You could ask if the film really needed so much. What, for instance, if they had edited out the scene with the priest saying Vijay’s days are numbered? But again, you go back to the first scene (in black-and-white) and see that Vijay lives to be 60. Everything is interconnected. There is a clean vision. If there is a Hindu yagna, there is a Christian priest, we get Sikh relatives, and we also get a Muslim wedding. When the hero is almost down and out in a fight, he recalls his father’s words and that brings him back to life. This is a grand, all-inclusive masala world, but in a post-millennial way. Like in Khalnayak, the man with “villain” qualities is the “hero”, but unlike those earlier movies, the moral lines are blurred. Vijay is so lost in the wars in own head – as his wife tells him – that he doesn’t seem to have an end goal in mind. “Getting his father’s approval” may have been the original end goal, but after a while, he behaves like a pure animal, doing exactly what he wants to do, with none of the boundaries of “civilisation”. When his sister is teased, he lets loose a machine gun in school. He tells his wife he will never cheat on her, and then he does. Not even the sight of a pregnant woman whose water has just broken can soften him, any more than a lion is going to pity an infant gazelle. Prey is prey. Like Arjun Reddy, Animal appears like a no-holds-barred, uncensored wallow inside the director’s head. Sandeep definitely seems to be putting bits of himself out there. If Arjun Reddy had a derogatory attitude towards a “fat girl”, Vijay’s father here yells that Vijay is “putting on weight like a pig”. Sandeep puts out his id. He puts out moments that other directors may be too embarrassed to show that they even think of, even for fictional purposes – like one where Vijay walks naked, or when he tells his wife not to remarry after his death, or when he tortures her by tugging and releasing her bra strap. The act leaves red marks on her back the way Vijay’s schoolteacher’s caning left a red mark on his palm. I can’t say I liked Animal in its entirety, but amidst so many filmmakers whose work seems either derivative or boring or award-seeking or critical-approval-seeking, this rawness is exhilarating. I think those of us who like these movies may do so because – at least for three hours – they bring out the animal in us that we keep caged at all other times. \\n\\t4. There are two kinds of \\'shooting\\' in Karthik Subbaraj\\'s new movie: the kind you do with the gun, and the kind you do with a movie camera. At one point, there\\'s a standoff between these two kinds of shooting: a man points his gun at a man who points a camera back at him. Jigarthanda DoubleX is not about which man \\'wins\\'. But if you have seen Part 1, I don\\'t think you\\'ll be surprised to learn what this film\\'s message is. It\\'s this: Cinema is the most powerful weapon we have. And the beauty – the real beauty – of this message is that it is not presented as a stagy speech, or as mere words. It is presented as… a piece of cinema. It is played out on a big screen, as a film within a film. If the message is about the medium, this medium is how the message is conveyed. The meta-ness is exhilarating. There are several films within Jigarthanda DoubleX, and let\\'s first look at the most obvious one: the sequel to the 2014 film starring Siddharth, Bobby Simha and Lakshmi Menon. The parallels are many. There\\'s the name \\'Sethu\\', the famous brother-sister song from Pasamalar, the central “story” that a criminal\\'s autobiography is being made into a movie. There\\'s an instance of double-crossing, and the true intent of the filmmaker remains unknown to the gangster – again, just like in Part 1. There\\'s cinema being created under a false pretext, and then, there\\'s the magic of cinema itself. When a filmmaker says \\'Action!\\', he feels something coursing through him, like electricity. His actor feels something, too. But these references apart, DoubleX is not really an extension of Jigarthanda. You see why Karthik calls it \\'a sequel in spirit\\'.  The opening scenes set up a forest-dwelling Veerappan-like criminal who kills elephants for tusks. To make things worse for the tribals who live there, we have a ganja-smoking State-appointed cop with zero conscience. To counter this man, this menace, this bad cop, it\\'s not just enough to bring in a good cop. A line of dialogue suggests that something much more is needed, almost like a messiah. And that messiah is… cinema. The people speaking these lines don\\'t know that yet, and neither do we – because Karthik diverts us by mimicking the dynamics of the earlier film. He introduces us to a tribal-rowdy named Caesar and a filmmaker named Kirubai, played by Raghava Lawrence and SJ Suryah. The third \"hero\" in this film is Clint Eastwood, who\\'s there from start to finish as an almost spiritual presence. The scene that has Caesar in a shootout in front of the \\'Let Red go\\' bit from For a Few Dollars More… it\\'s cine-geek heaven!. Everything in DoubleX loops back to Cinema. Kirubai wants to become a cop. Thanks to cinema, he becomes a dispenser of justice and brings down the bad guys. Caesar is a gunda. Thanks to cinema, his story is diverted into the forest, and there he regains his humanity. The politician played by Ilavarasu says he wants to be the CM. Much later, thanks to cinema, he realises that there are other ways to serve people. There\\'s also the sense that things are fair in cinema in a way they aren\\'t in real life. Look at Clint Eastwood in his films – he never shoots an unarmed man. Even the echo of a scene from Part 1 where a man is burnt alive has to do with cinema. Here, a man is covered with celluloid reels and set on fire. There are fun and games. A bit about a veena made me laugh out loud, as did the mispronunciation of \\'pan-India\\' as \\'Pandya\\'. And I loved the MacGuffin: we are made to think that this is about the creation of a dark-skinned hero (and given Karthik\\'s Rajinikanth fandom, I really thought it would be a veiled story of Rajinikanth). But no! That\\'s where the story begins, sure, but that\\'s not where it ends. The ending is – again – about cinema. It is about a reel-life leading man becoming a real-life hero. But this is not a fun-and-games movie. It is far more serious in tone than its predecessor, and it is Karthik’s most political movie to date. You could point to Mercury and say that that film, too, was about an issue. But there, the issue was folded into a larger “genre” story. Here, the issue is right out in front, and this is one of the rare times I have seen a “message movie” work in Tamil cinema. On the surface, we have seen many Tamil films speak out about issues and against the government, but not in this way, not with so much love for cinema, and not with so much craft. Karthik has always been a dynamic filmmaker, but here, with his fantastic cinematographer Thirunavukkarasu, he creates deep frames filled with life. There’s always something happening in some corner, and Shafique Mohamed Ali’s editing sweeps us from frame to frame without the dynamism being lost. We seem to be in constant motion. Then, of course, we have Santhosh Narayanan’s score, which takes its cues from Spaghetti Westerns. There are many films that do not need a score at all, but something as visually and dramatically flamboyant as DoubleX is impossible to imagine without the whistling and the trumpets and the cheeky little harmonica.  What could have been better? Shine Tom Chacko is a star with political ambitions. Nimisha Sajayan is Caesar\\'s wife. They don\\'t get much to do. A plot point about epileptic fits is very clever in terms of how it comes back into the story, but the person never experiences this condition again and I wondered why. After the film is over, you see the Big Picture of the narrative – but while watching it, I kept fidgeting a bit, wondering where it was heading. Of course, that, ultimately, is part of the charm. But maybe these diversions could have been smoother. But these are small complaints in the face of this massive achievement, which is also an ode to Nature, to the tribal way of life. When an oracle says that these men will get what they want but not in the way they expect, it\\'s a reminder of the unpredictability of life itself. It is a throwaway scene, but it is so profound.  When you see a wild animal give birth, when you see the mothers of the herd helping the infant, and when you see forests on the verge of vanishing, you may realise that your petty squabbles and revenge fantasies are irrelevant in the larger scheme of things. Karthik has rarely been so deeply emotional in his cinema, and his leading men have rarely been better. SJ Suryah keeps finding new ways to exploit his innate “actorliness”, and here we get a poignant shade of the actor. As for Raghava Lawrence, I can’t say I have seen him in anything requiring him to act, but he’s wonderful here. You cannot imagine another performer in his place. DoubleX ends with the promise of a sequel, but whatever the plot of that film is, I am sure it will continue the tradition of showcasing its creator’s love for cinema, for art.\\n\\t5. Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s superb new movie is based on real events, as recorded in Anurag Pathak’s book, 12th Fail. It features Vikrant Massey as Manoj, a young man from the Chambal region who, inspired by a policeman, wants to become one himself. And what inspires him about this policeman? His tendency to tell the truth. It must also help that Manoj’s father is himself a satyavadi. The man is suspended after refusing to aid the lie that the area’s farmers got the seeds they were allotted. (The unsurprising truth is that government officers sold the seeds in the black market.) The result of this suspension is a very funny scene with guns, which shows that we are in a dreaded dacoit-land, where firearms are whipped out for the smallest of disputes.  The odds are against Manoj, because the UPSC exam is a distant dream for someone from his background. (A character says, out of two-lakh ‘Hindi-medium’ aspirants for IAS/IPS, only 25-30 get selected.) And we find ourselves in an underdog story. Unlike the usual “triumph of the spirit” crap usually dished out by the movies, we seem to be watching the life and times of a very real man and not the life and times of a templated narrative arc. Walking into 12th Fail, I wondered: How can the story of a man studying for the UPSC exams be made… well, un-boring? Here’s how. The writing is a marvel of small things that add up to grand payoffs. Look at the way Manoj’s grandmother refuses to part with her pension, even when the family is in the direst of situations. And when she finally parts with this money – willingly – and when something happens to this money, the event hits you like a lead brick.  The screenplay is littered with lead bricks. The part where the words “terrorism” and “tourism” play off one another. The part where the father says, “Hum jaise log kahaan jeet paayenge,” and the bright-eyed son replies, “Par haar bhi nahin maanenge na!” The rousing mini-slogan (#Restart), which says that even if you hit rock bottom, you can always begin the climb all over again. The quiet rebellion of the heroine, Shraddha, played by Medha Shankar (in fact, the way the whole \\'friendship to romance\\' angle is written). Everything starts soft and hits hard. Only in the final portions – say, when an intimidating examiner looms large in the frame – do we feel we have entered a zone that’s a little “filmy”, but only a little, and only because the preceding stretches have been so remarkably underplayed. At several points, my eyes went moist. There’s nothing showy, and even a shot where Manoj is reflected in the rear-view mirror of a vehicle has meaning, a purpose. The result is some of the purest filmmaking I’ve seen. And this purity reflects in every single performance. Medha Shankar is a fragile presence, but inside, she is all steel. As for Vikrant, he knows he has the role he has been waiting for, the role of a lifetime: he grabs it and runs with it. Manoj is a Kalam-reading idealist, who’s stubborn about the way he wants to get ahead. So the lines that drop from him don’t sound like preachy lectures, even when the line itself is a preachy mini-lecture. A cop tells Manoj: “Chhote se ho, par dum hai tum mein”. Vikrant uses his slight stature to suggest the internal strength of an underdog. He may not look strong, but inside, he’s Atlas. His eyes are ablaze with the crazy-light we see in great eccentrics. There’s no shame in him that he’s doing menial jobs to survive, because these are honest and truthful ways to survive.  And that is the film’s crux: not that a “12th-fail” Hindi-medium student achieves his dream, but that he does so in an honest and truthful manner. This is usually the kind of “noble” premise that makes me do a quick U-turn and run for my life, but 12th Fail is so light on its feet. Like its protagonist, the film itself feels truthful and honest. Everything is one of a piece. When Manoj goes from his village to a big city (Gwalior) and then to a bigger city (Delhi), he loses things, he gains a male friend (Sanjay Bishnoi), he gains a female friend in Shraddha, he gets betrayed and rejected and accepted again, a clock keeps ticking away (literally), and Fate keeps playing Snakes and Ladders with him – and all of this is captured like the flow of life, without pausing for effect or to highlight the melodramatic potential in a situation. 12th Fail is one of the rare mainstream films that uses music sparingly. The score, reminiscent of Ravi Shankar’s plaintive music for Pather Panchali, is made from  a few Indian instruments, and it plays at the end of scenes rather than over them. The music – therefore – feels earned, like a reward for something that has just happened. So if we feel what we feel, it is due to the acting and the staging and the direction, and not because a solo violin is tugging at our heartstrings and saying, “Cry, cry, cry…” This can only come from a confident filmmaker, and his confidence is infectious. Rangarajan Ramabadran’s handheld cinematography is the equivalent of a fly on the wall, moving in close when Shraddha begins to sing, or rushing downstairs with Manoj, or registering the unsteadiness of a single emotional man in a sea of people. The gentlest focus shift happens when Shraddha argues with her father, and the one track/trolley overhead shot occurs when Manoj walks into a room filled with people like him, to show him in the midst of many. 12th Fail strips away all artifice from filmmaking. It proves that you can show real-life struggles of the underprivileged without it all feeling like you are reading a finger-wagging newspaper editorial by a buttoned-up academic. Even the interval-point high: we may hear a ringing sound, but the scene itself is muted. Even the “I love you” scene: it’s wistful and it produces an emotional high, especially with the closure against the backdrop of pink mountain skies, but the sequence itself is played in a minor key. Even the midway scene where Manoj returns home as a failure: it contains a breakdown, but does not contain melodrama. The feelings come from Manoj and from the people around him, and they aren’t “calculated” to make the audience feel – and that’s why we feel these emotions all the more. The less we are manipulated, the more we respect the film, the filmmaking. In that respect, 12th Fail earns top marks.\\n\\t6. There is an early scene in SU Arun Kumar\\'s Chithha where Sakthi (Nimisha Sajayan) has to use a public toilet. The floor is dirty, and filled with water. A woman who has used the stall Sakthi is standing in line for opens the door and leaves without cleaning up. Sakthi calls her back, forcefully, and makes her clean up. This small moment tells us a lot about Sakthi – for instance, she is not one to take things lying down. And this display of strength blooms fully when she runs into Eswaran (Siddharth), her one-time boyfriend who left her without an explanation. Even without the toilet scene, even if Sakthi had shown her anger only after she ran into Eswaran, we would have had an insight into her emotions – but that early scene tells us how, even in the absence of Eswaran, Sakthi is determined not to be a pushover again. We see who she is, and then we see why she became that way.  This is beautiful character-writing, and it\\'s all over this film, which centres on the loving relationship between Eswaran and his dead brother\\'s daughter (Sundari, played by the excellent Sahasra Shree). Eswaran has become the little girl\\'s kinda-sorta foster father, and his relationship with his sister-in-law (Anjali Nair) is equally solid. He is the man of the house, and the situation is so lived-in and so comfortable that there\\'s no awkwardness when they are in close proximity in a cramped kitchen or when he is buying sanitary napkins for her. They give off bestie vibes, and it works wonderfully. There\\'s no weeping, no wailing about the past. These are two people who have accepted a situation and have moved on and are trying to make the best of what life is throwing at them. The chemistry between Siddharth and Anjali Nair is remarkably understated – and that is the flavour of most of the first half. The A-for-apple background score kills the mood frequently. When Eswaran picks his cute niece up from school, we hear cutesy music, which totally undermines the emotion he was feeling when he met his ex just a little while ago. Each stretch is scored to hype up whatever emotion it represents, and this is an inevitable evil we have come to accept in our cinema. But to compensate, Balaji Subramanyam\\'s cinematography is exquisitely “invisible”. Arun Kumar, in his earlier films, has never displayed this kind of eye for staging, and a lot of the time, we get two or three things being swept into a single, economical, non-showy camera movement. After a mid-shot featuring a female cop (a superb newcomer named Jhansi), the camera follows her as she turns, and we get a wide shot featuring Eeswaran somewhere in the distance. This sort of thing keeps happening over and over, and the camera is alive to both the general environment and the particular proceedings in this story, whether it’s a man fixing a street light or Eswaran crying his heart out in the bathroom. The frames are to die for. Another fantastic bit of staging occurs when the actors move out of the frame, and the camera stays fixated on an empty street – we do not see what these actors are doing beyond the field of the camera. And what exactly did they do? What happened, exactly? The mystery in the visual ties neatly into the unknowability of what really happened. Eswaran is accused of sexually abusing a little girl, and the screenplay and the editing take these portions to soaring heights. There\\'s not one cliche in how all this information is presented to us. Add to this Siddharth\\'s most sincere, committed, and affecting performance to date, and we are left shattered. This portion brings to fore the very crux of child abuse – that a lot of the time, the perpetrator is someone as close and as \\'likeable\\' as Eswaran. The screenplay measures out what we need to know in \\'real time\\', just like how the characters who have experienced these events would recall them, instead of dumping us with big stretches of exposition. So even though the love track isn\\'t strictly \\'necessary\\' in this story of abuse, it fits smoothly because it was a part of Eswaran before the movie began and it looks like an organic extension of his life now. We are spared the \\'falling in love\\' moment, though we do get a fantastic duet: ‘Kangal edho theda’, composed by Dhibu Ninan Thomas. This lived-in quality, this ability of the film to suggest that its characters have had lives before we meet them, is its greatest strength. Everyone seems so fully-formed, so real. And these are not perfect characters, either. Sundari ends up stealing something, and we get to see the peer pressure a little girl faces at school. Suresh A Prasad is the editor. His sharp rhythms (which could also be an offshoot of the screenplay) keep preventing the scenes from getting into obvious zones. For instance, after Sundari\\'s mother slaps her, we cut to a serene scene of the child sleeping with her \\'chithha\\', her chittappa Eswaran. Even a conflict that’s yet to come is built up carefully, with Eswaran humiliating a man by accidentally shoving him into a gutter. And later, when this man turns on Eswaran, you know where the extra animosity is coming from. The parts that stick out are the ones that let us know in advance what lies ahead: when two cops talk about the rape of a minor a few scenes before a little girl gets into an auto, there is no surprise left. After this point is where I felt the film made a misstep. When you are wrongfully accused of a horrible crime by the very people you love, when your sister-in-law suddenly changes the way she looks at you, when your close friend suspects you, one part inside you surely dies – as we saw in the wonderful Danish film, The Hunt. I felt Chithha needed to dwell on Eswaran’s emotions a little more – but he bounces back into action almost as though this were a minor blip in his life, as the film splits into two very different tracks. (You could say the first half of the film looks inward, while the second half is all outward.) One track is a procedural about the hunt for a serial child molester. The other track is about Eswaran’s turning into a vigilante, determined to kill the bad guy. Yes, you could argue that this latter aspect of Eswaran has a lot to do with his humiliation after being falsely accused, but the emotions needed to be way deeper – because in his own way, the (wrongfully) accused suffers as much as the abused. I also wished Sakthi’s revelation at the end had not tied so neatly into the film’s overall themes. Nimisha Sajayan, of course, totally sells the moment. She is incapable of giving a dishonest performance. But it’s too much. It’s too convenient. So yes, the second half feels looser and less intense. The villain’s scenes seem caricaturish when compared to the scenes with everyone else. And a sense of predictability sets in when we see Sundari. (Why didn’t they keep the suspense of whether she is still alive?) We seem to be in a regular thriller. But even in the portions where, say, a clue is found rather randomly, the filmmaking is so good that you easily let go of these misgivings. When Eswaran breaks down after believing Sundari is dead, the camera allows him to retain his dignity by not going close. It stays wide, at a respectable distance. You may question where the film goes, but whatever choices the director makes, he sticks to them with utter conviction. Even the many shots of Eswaran sleeping beside his niece have a devastating payoff in a mortuary. Chithha  shows us all aspects of child rape, from the way cases are conducted to the attitudes that need changing. Sakthi tells Eswaran that it’s not about punishing the villain as much as being there for Sundari at a time she really needs him. At this point, the Hero is emasculated, and in a good way. He gets rid of his toxic “heroism”, and realises that it’s better to be a hero to his niece than to be the hero who conquers the villain. To accomplish all this in a “mainstream” format is a truly remarkable achievement.\\n\\t7. When Christopher Nolan announced a biopic, of all things, I was curious. It\\'s like Hitchcock making a Fred Astaire musical. It\\'s like Spielberg making Saw. It\\'s like Scorsese making a screwball comedy or a Western. There\\'s nothing to say that a filmmaker cannot change pace, and before he became Christropher Nolan™, we did get a superb psychological thriller in Insomnia. But now that he\\'s trademarked as one of the biggest filmmakers (who makes films as big as his reputation, with big IMAX cameras for big IMAX screens), what could have possibly interested him in the intricacies and intimacies of \"normal life\" – even if it is the life of J Robert Oppenheimer, \"The Father of the Atomic Bomb\"? The real subject of Oppenheimer, therefore, is not the life and times of its protagonist, but whether Nolan can enter the subatomic levels of the human psyche. In other words, do we know more about Oppenheimer coming out than we did going in? The answer is yes and no. On a broad level, yes, we do get to see the various types of education the man put himself through. We get to see him associating with people we have only read about in Physics books: Einstein and Niels Bohr and Enrico Fermi. We see his facility with learning languages: he even reads Sanskrit, in the only cinematic instance of the Bhagavad Gita being used in a bedroom scene. We see his Left-leaning tendencies, even if he does not officially join the Communist party. We see him with a wife, a lover – both very tragically underwritten. And we see Oppenheimer being questioned, after the “success” of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, about his allegiance to America. What we don’t see is a distinct directorial vision. Let me explain this with a spectacular early stretch from Interstellar, when the protagonist leaves his family to fly off into space. It’s a super-intense stretch, and you really feel the bigness of the emotion on a big IMAX screen. The screaming, weeping daughter runs out, only to be greeted by the dust raised by her father’s speeding car. She cannot see him. Then we get the other point-of-view shot, from the side of the car – this time, the clouds of dust obscure the father’s view of his house and his family. The collected, composed nature of the grandfather and brother is contrasted with the emotional nature of father and daughter. And over the tear-filled father’s face, we get one of Nolan’s most effective instances of playing with time. He fuses the visual of the speeding car with the audio of the countdown – that is, the present and the immediate future – and… boom! The screen is suddenly filled with fire as the rocketship takes off. I remember feeling breathless and knocked out in the theatre. The only time we see this kind of auteur-ial signature in Oppenheimer is during the Trinity test, which was the first time a nuclear device was detonated. Nolan ratchets up the tension almost unbearably in the minutes leading up to the test (there’s another countdown clock here, a wonderfully analog version compared to the digital one in Interstellar) – and when the bomb goes off, there’s just silence. In a film scattered with religious references, this stretch feels almost… sacred. Even if you are not the religious type, I’ll bet you’ll feel something seeing the dreadful mushroom clouds. It’s as though we are both playing God and witnessing the wrath of God. Silence is the only possible soundtrack. And then the thunderous sound hits, and… boom! The implication that humankind has been altered forever is unmistakable. But the rest of the time, Oppenheimer is more dutiful than dazzling, more admirable than awe-inspiring. The most surprising thing about the film is that it feels so much like other, earlier films. The early “he did this, and then he did that” portions feel like any other biopic that ticks off the protagonist’s traits and achievements. The big hearings feel like the portions of The Godfather: Part II where Michael Corelone is under trial. And amidst this, the most important aspect of Oppenheimer never comes through. We are told about his guilt in creating this genocidal weapon, but we never feel the weight of this guilt – because the film is always in a hurry to rush to the next bit of exposition, the next stretch of talk. (And trust me, there is a lot of talk.) There is no stay on any single emotion. The talking is all on the outside, but what we really needed to hear is Oppenheimer’s inner voice. Oppenheimer is certainly a watchable film. There’s a great cast including Matt Damon, Kenneth Branagh, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, a fabulous Gary Oldman, and of course, Cillian Murphy, who does more for the character than the writing does for him. Also, Nolan does his patented “time thing” – both screenplay-wise and editing-wise – to keep things moving at express speed. Let’s take the part where Oppenheimer meets an army officer named Pash, played by Casey Affleck. We get three timelines: the present, where Oppenheimer meets Pash; the immediate future where the Matt Damon character asks Oppenheimer about this meeting with Pash; and the far future, where this meeting with Pash is discussed in front of the interrogating committee. So yes, the talkiness of the film never makes it “boring”. But there’s also a feeling of things being very generic, especially in the way the “real villain” is exposed at the end. It feels right out of a cheap melodrama. The Florence Pugh character, whom Oppenheimer has an affair with, never feels like she’s fully there. And so when he grieves the end of the relationship, the grief does not pierce us. Emily Blunt plays Oppenheimer’s wife as a stern, strong woman whose early scenes with her infant are entirely stripped of dramatic potential, and even in her later scenes of being a pillar of support, she comes across more like a placeholder than a person. Oppenheimer’s brother, similarly, is spoken about as being central to his life, but the man barely registers. The best biopics in recent times – Lincoln, Steve Jobs –  were highly focused, and with a few events, we broke into the psyche of the subjects. Oppenheimer crams in so much that it is diffuse to the point of seeming vaporous. The more we see of the man, the less we seem to really know him. Early on, we seem to be in the “troubled genius” biopic mode. Eventually, we end up with the biopic of a modern-day Jesus Christ, nailed on a cross for being an anti-war martyr. Oppenheimer’s wife keeps asking him to fight back, and you feel her frustration. But this is also the easiest way to earn the audience’s sympathy. Had Oppenheimer fought back, had he been more complex, we may not have “liked” him so much – and for all the technical/screenwriting complexity that marks Nolan;’s work, he’s never been one for psychological complexity. I liked Nolan’s decision to show things mainly from his protagonist’s point of view. So we never see the Hiroshima/Nagasaki bombings. We hear of them over the radio, like Oppenheimer does. We don’t see images of what happened to the Japanese in these cities in the days after the war. We either hear about the horrible after-effects, or see them imagined through Oppenheimer’s eyes, as he’s hit by visions while doing regular things like addressing an audience. But as if to compensate, every little thing Oppenheimer hears is supplemented by a visual that lasts a fraction of a second. For instance, if we hear about a bomb blast in Halifax, the screen micro-cuts to fragments of an explosion before we cut back to the talking that’s going on about the bomb blast in Halifax. It’s as though the non-stop information dump isn’t keeping the movie busy enough, and Nolan felt we needed the occasional Nolan-esque visuals to keep his fans interested. Speaking of Nolan-esque, there’s also the non-stop music. And I really couldn’t see why this film needed to be shot in IMAX, or why the fussy back and forth between colour and black-and-white was needed.  Yes, a lot of these decisions have been “pre-sold” and explained to us through interviews and promos, but do they feel true to us while we watch it? That’s the question. I am not a fan of Tenet, but at least it felt like the distinctive work of a very distinctive filmmaker. It had scope. It was wildly ambitious. Oppenheimer feels so bland in comparison, though it is – overall – the better film. At least, it is clean, one of a piece. It doesn’t trip over itself trying to be “clever”. But when David Lean made Lawrence of Arabia, which ran 30 minutes more than this three-hour film, it felt like we were inside the man’s molecules. With Oppenheimer, we feel like we are watching the man through a telescope, or getting a grasp of him by skimming through a Wikipedia page. He looms large on the screen, as though you can reach out and touch him. And yet he feels so distant.\\n\\t8. We are back on Pandora. We move through blue mists. We soar past the flying mountains we know from the earlier film. We enter the forest with winged creatures as sunlight falls in shafts, filtered by the thick flora. And then Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) opens his mouth and brings us crashing down to earth. He says, \"The forests of Pandora have many dangers, but the biggest danger is that you may grow to love her too much.\" And we instantly are reminded of both the pluses and minuses of the first Avatar. I wrote then: \"The visuals are expectedly eye-popping, especially in 3-D, but couldn’t they have diverted a few more dollars towards the script?\" I\\'d say the same about Avatar 2: The Way of the Water. It\\'s a great theme-park ride. As a movie, though, it makes you want to have a long interview with James Cameron about his big psychological shift from muscular action filmmaker to New Age-y, touchy-feely, digital world-builder. There are many directors who have had a great run of consistently great films. Francis Ford Coppola comes to mind. Between 1972 and 1979, he made The Godfather, The Conversation, The Godfather Part 2, and the magnificent Apocalypse Now, which was an IMAX movie before IMAX was invented. James Cameron is another. He made The Terminator in 1984. He followed it up with Aliens, Abyss, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, and True Lies, in 1994. He proved himself a pitiless manipulator of our senses. He made the action sing like poetry. And then, something happened. He made The Titanic, and though the disaster sequences were epic, the love story exposed his weaknesses in dramatic writing. He\\'s never really recovered. For all the complicated CGI work on Avatar 2, there isn\\'t a single suspenseful sequence like the one in, say, Aliens, where the Sigourney Weaver character enters the lair of the mother alien. There, you held your breath. Here, you just keep thinking that it\\'s breathtaking. The story of Avatar 2 makes little practical sense. For a former marine, Jake Sully does not seem to anticipate the return of the villains from Part 1. He does not equip his tribe with weapons or training in anticipation of that possibility. When he goes into hiding with a colony of sea people – this is when the screen turns into a gorgeous aquarium – he does not seem to realise that he is bringing his war to these innocents. There are two action scenes with identical events of kids being captured – though I must say that the second action sequence is brilliantly shot, CGI-ed, and edited. It is a long, long stretch and it is the one place where we see flashes of the genius James Cameron used to be. Based on the Avatar films, Cameron is certainly a visionary. He is taking movie technology to new places, and future filmmakers will no doubt owe a big debt to Cameron\\'s efforts. But in the present, while inside the IMAX theatre, all I could think was this: my eyes are being entertained, my heart and mind not so much. Actors like Kate Winslet and Sigourney Weaver are given little to do. There are quite a few subplots with immense possibility for emotion: the troubled relationship between a father and son, the eco-bonding of a young girl with Nature, or the wonderfully strange friendship between a boy and a whale-like creature. But none of this is developed and when a major character dies at the end, it feels like an extension of a theme-park ride rather than a shattering loss. Think of the mother-child bond that animated Aliens, or the father-son shadow that loomed over Terminator2: Judgment Day… No, actually, it\\'s better not to think about all that. Still, the answer to the \\'should you watch it?\\' question is a no-brainer. You should, and on the biggest possible screen. But for hard-core James Cameron fans, you should also be prepared for confirmation that one of the greatest pure-action filmmakers of all time has been snatched away from us.\\n\\t9. It\\'s a cause for much joy when a filmmaker known for his penchant for science fiction offers visual callbacks to iconic films in the genre in the opening moments of his latest, Dune: Part Two. Based on the books by Frank Herbert, Part Two, which picks up from Dune: Part One, begins with a voiceover belonging to Florence Pugh that sounds eerily similar to Linda Hamilton\\'s in the Terminator films. The accompanying image of bodies burnt, too, recalls James Cameron\\'s dystopian nightmare. The subsequent image of an embryo is reminiscent of the final image from Stanley Kubrick\\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey. I began thinking of how death and birth (or rebirth) become a recurring theme in Part Two.    Villeneuve alternates these two events inventively at different junctures in this sequel, which boasts more characters and a richer, more majestic scale than its predecessor. There is a supposedly poisonous drink called the \\'Water of Life\\' that \\'kills\\' and rejuvenates (rebirth) at once. Take Timothee Chalamet\\'s Paul Atreides, destined to be the eventual messianic figure known as Kwisatz Haderach or Muad\\'Dib (among other names). The once-vulnerable young boy undergoes a gradual transformation into an authoritative figure looked at as \\'The One\\' who will lead the good guys to salvation. The same death-rebirth process occurs to his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), also evolving into a more chilling, commanding force later. The drink offers enhancement of visions to someone already blessed with the power of foreseeing future events or reading someone\\'s history merely by looking at them.   Film critic Richard Brody recently tweeted, in response to an interview of Villeneuve where he said he hates dialogue, that the gifted Quebec filmmaker doesn\\'t know how to film them. While disagreeing with Brody that this doesnt apply to all films of Villeneuve, I must point out that it was a glaring shortcoming of Dune: Part One, in which the characters were whispering their lines most of the time, to a point that got me annoyed and, almost put me to sleep. While Part Two doesnt get saved from banal, lifeless dialogues whenever it pauses between high-octane action, it does a relatively better job of holding our attention because, among its various merits, are Zendayas emotionally affecting performance and Javier Bardems successful deadpan comical timing.    Part Two is also, fortunately, much more imaginative at staging a giant spectacle. The design of inanimate objects draws evident comparison to insects. The sequel re-introduces us to a few of the machines from Part One, apart from introducing newer and bigger ones. Suffice it to say that the film is a sci-fi/fantasy fans dream come true. Villeneuve and the extraordinary imagination of cinematographer Greig Fraser once again reinforce the impression of human beings appearing dwarfed in relation to their internal and external environments. In one scene, assassins drop dead like flies from a cliff. In another, armies gathering for a massive battle resemble ants while a shiny globe-looking spacecraft emanating flames levitates in the distance.  Part Two is Villeneuve channelling his inner Ridley Scott. Like the latters recent Napoleon, we see Villeneuve delivering, by far, his biggest epic. The brown-grey-black colour palette may get tiresome for some -- you can only do so much in the desert -- but Villeneuve, Fraser, production designer Patrice Vermette and visual effects artist Paul Lambert paint in broad strokes with limited colours. The result is minimalist yet staggering. Take a gladiatorial match which showcases the slithery, ghostly menace of the films scene-stealing principal villain, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, played by Austin Butler. The entire sequence is a black-and-white dream, unlike anything Ive seen before, its immensity and grandeur matched by anything in Tron: Legacy or The Tragedy of Macbeth.   I must bring up Terminator and 2001 again because, looking at the Dune films in their entirety, you see Villeneuve trying to merge the sensibilities of the Cameron and the Kubrick films, not always a harmonious combination. Part One, which seemed like an action epic by Terrence Malick, had a soporific quality that worked against it in some places. Such moments are fewer in Part Two. The other strange aspect working against it -- and this is no fault of Villeneuve -- is the strong sense of deja vu it evokes. We saw the story of the \"chosen one\" who may or may not get seduced by a dark path, prophecies, or the fear in ones power explored better in other sci-fi/fantasy epics such as The Matrix trilogy or the George Lucas-directed Star Wars. Or what about the outsider trying to be one of a rebel group? (as in Lawrence of Arabia) Or what about the hero trying to tame a giant creature, which later becomes a mode of transport for the characters? (Avatar, which draws heavily from Herberts novel). Villeneuves mammoth challenge involves making us aware of the intricacies and minutiae of Dunes immense world-building and focusing on its characters simultaneously. Its an undertaking that Villeneuve pulls off wonderfully, even if not entirely satisfactory. Some motivations remain unclear; the drastic plot development in a couple of instances might find a better explanation in the books. Part Two ends with a hint at a holy war likely to be explored in Part Three, which I cant wait to see.\\n\\t10.  Alex Garland\\'s films have often elicited strange and polarising reactions. Civil War is no different. It is, by far, the biggest film he has done in terms of scale, but his films, no matter how minimal they look, have, under their surface, explored complex themes and emotions. Now, for an Indian viewer, the events presented on the screen may not seem relatable at first glance, but look closer, and you will see some elements bearing a close resemblance to what\\'s happening in our own country.   Take the entire segment with an unnervingly menacing and intimidating Jesse Plemons, who asks Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Maura, and Cailee Spaeny where they are from in America to ascertain \"How American\" they are. Now, that sounds quite similar to being asked, \"How Indian are you?\" sometimes by the so-called \"patriotic\" folks who live in Dubai or the U.S.   From beginning to end, the film is a rollercoaster ride, with a pall of gloom following each individual -- right from Kirsten Dunst\\'s character: a disillusioned and battle-weary photographer who has seen and been in the most tragic and trauma-inducing circumstances. So when she crosses paths with Cailee Spaeny\\'s character, she sees her younger self in her, with the same enthusiasm and cockiness that she probably felt once.   Speaking of the film\\'s point of view, different people will have different takes on this, but I felt it belongs to Kirsten Dunst\\'s character, and its feelings mirror hers. This is one of those films that isn\\'t interested in spelling everything out for the viewers.   For example, when the film begins, something terrible has happened, and the United States is in the middle of a civil war. There\\'s no explanation given as to how and why it happened. We see a military outfit called Western Forces engaged in conflict with the U.S. government military. Perhaps this is a rogue outfit like the one we saw in the Michael Bay movie, The Rock. We are planted in the middle of the chaos, but the film is sensible enough to respect the audience\\'s intelligence and wants us to put together all the pieces of the puzzle, provided we get all of it.   Take the situation where two snipers are engaged in eliminating an opponent holed up inside a home. Their immediate concern is survival, not politics. This situation speaks about something. There\\'s another instance where a shopkeeper casually reads a book without being bothered about what happens on the outside. The film is probably telling us to get out there and do something about the very problem that concerns us instead of complaining about it on social media.   The film also seems to be saying something about the nature of spectacle and how we see it, and the way Alex Garland treats spectacle and violence is interesting. At times, it panders to blockbuster movie buffs and at others, it dilutes the intensity of the action, as though it wants to deprive the former of the fun and joy they get out of it.   Again, without spelling anything out, it invites us to ask questions about these things. Some of the scenes involving photojournalists remind us of the attitude of those who record an event with their camera without bothering to get involved or help the suffering or the sensation-hungry news organisations whose only concern is to get a quote, with no regard for the well-being of the person giving it.     All this unglamorous mayhem plays out on a large, immersive canvas that makes you feel the unease the characters feel at any moment. The efficient sound design is a combination of choices that either impart a hypnotic quality to the proceedings through some esoteric song choices or use complete silence and ambient noises to build tension.   I found this to be a thought-provoking exercise in the same vein as, say, Jonathan Glazer\\'s The Zone of Interest. Both films rely mainly on images to tell its story. Naturally, this approach is going to frustrate some, and runs the risk of being labelled pretentious by certain groups, but the films that do that are the most interesting, wouldn\\'t you agree?\\n\\t11.  Rishab Shetty writes, directs, and delivers a joyous and very exuberant performance as Shiva, the protagonist of Kantara – but he\\'s absent from the opening stretch that is set in the nineteenth century. We hear a tale about a king who had everything. He had the love of his family. He had the love of his subjects. What he did not have was peace of mind. There\\'s a second time period, in the mid-1970s, and a third, in 1990. The screenplay uses many devices to tie the past and the present – or rather, to bring the past to the present and show how the two are always intertwined. There\\'s the sound of anklets heard in a forest. There\\'s a near-mythical sword passed on from the days of the king to the days we find Shiva in. There\\'s the reference to Vishnu\\'s third incarnation, Varaha Avatar, where the god became a boar. And the most important past-present connection is a fearsome scream, which is also a metaphor for the cry of anguish of the landless. We hear this cry in the present-day Bhoota Kola performances, and we get into the meat of the plot: Who \"owns\" the forests? Or to extend this point, who owns Nature? The tribals who have lived in these lands for centuries? The government, which draws boundaries and creates forest reserves and wants to relocate these tribals? Or the local landlords, who still think that their ancestors gave away these lands, and so these lands are – in a sense – still theirs? Attached to this supertext is the subtext of whether we can really reject our identity. This question is posed through Shiva, who hails from a family of Bhoota Kola performers, but refuses to have anything to do with the folk-art form. It has something to do with his nightmares, which he must learn to face. Meanwhile, he is content getting a \"mass\" entry as a Kambala champion, a man who wins buffalo races. Kantara follows the classic template of The Chosen One, a man who appears ordinary but is destined for greatness. At first, Shiva is as ordinary as ordinary can be. He drinks. He hunts. He pinches a girl\\'s hip and peeps when she\\'s bathing. He\\'s called a \"fighter cock\", and he is constantly cursed by his mother. And like every self-respecting masala-movie hero, he locks horns with the antagonist, the man who will not allow him to do the things he likes to do. This man is the forest officer Murali, nicely played with gruff authority by Kishore. He represents the System, the government, and at least in one respect, he\\'s the opposite of Shiva: this man does things by the rulebook. The third vertex in this male-triangle movie is the landlord played by Achyuth Kumar. He always wears white, and his heart appears equally spotless, equally pure. But note his name: Devendra. It\\'s a lordly name. It refers to the Vedic god, Indra – as opposed to the more pagan god we see being worshipped by the tribals. There’s a bit of discrimination right there. In short, we are either in a masala movie disguised as folklore, or in folklore disguised as a masala movie. Either way, everything has a touch of symbolism. When Murali interferes with a Bhoota Kola performance, it\\'s also the government interfering in the centuries-old life and customs of tribals. When a tree falls on a Jeep, it almost seems like the forest is avenging itself on behalf of its people. And when the king\\'s sword returns in the story, we recall a promise being made and what would happen when it is broken. All of this is richly shot by Arvind S Kashyap, and elevated by B Ajaneesh Loknath\\'s score, which is simultaneously as big as rock music and as subtle as the gently rippling notes at the film\\'s opening. And some of the action choreography is superb. There are issues in the writing. The portions of Leela (Sapthami Gowda) falling for Shiva should have been better. There\\'s a taken-for-granted quality about this love story. And though Kantara is not exactly a whodunit, the villains are easy enough to spot from a mile away, and a character\\'s change of heart is entirely expected – meaning, the narrative could have used a lot more tension. And in such a story, I wish they\\'d avoided the cliches – like Shiva bursting in fury when his mother is slapped around, or the really cheap shot of a little girl being killed. But the bigger picture of Kantara is in the smaller details. It’s in the way Leela is torn between her affiliation to her job, i.e. the government, and her people, i.e. the tribals. It\\'s in the way Nature is manifested as wild animals, as forests, as fire, as rain. When Shiva is drenched in a downpour, he says he isn\\'t wet; he has been cleansed. It’s almost like Nature has performed a ritual on him. Despite the generic nature of the middle portions, the closing stretch complements the film’s opening beautifully. And there’s very little more potent than the rush of myth.\\n\\t12.  Balki\\'s Chup begins in classic serial killer-thriller fashion. On a rainy night, a gruesome murder is discovered. The victim is a film critic. There are knife slashes all over his body, and on his head, as is later discovered, there\\'s a star – as in, a star rating. So we have a novel signature: a man (or woman) who targets film critics and carves star ratings on them. Sunny Deol plays Arvind, the cop on the case, and he cracks the script\\'s cleverest aspect: the reason behind each of these bodies being mutilated the way they are. It\\'s delightfully perverse. This alone would have made for a cracker of a cat-and-mouse thriller, but Balki (who co-wrote the screenplay with Rishi Virmani and former critic Raja Sen) has other ideas. He introduces a parallel track: the romance between Dulquer Salmaan\\'s Danny and Shreya Dhanwanthary\\'s Nila/Neela. \"Nila\" is Tamil for moon. \"Neela\" is the name of the heroine of Nayakan. Saranya Ponvannan, the heroine of Nayakan, plays this heroine\\'s mother. Could there be a more \"Balki\" touch?   Film references abound in this gorgeously morbid love letter to cinema. It’s “gorgeous” because Vishal Sinha’s superb cinematography gives us both the rapturous colours of romance, thanks to Danny’s flower shop, as well as the matter-of-fact tone of a procedural. And it’s “morbid” (in a good way) because movie-love is taken to its extreme. When Danny gifts Nila a bouquet of paper flowers, it\\'s a nod to Guru Dutt\\'s Kaagaz Ke Phool, which means… paper flowers. Even the famous shaft lighting from that film is recreated, and it leads to the film\\'s central conceit. Who\\'s the real killer? The one who is actually doing the killings? Or the film critic, who mercilessly \"kills\" a film like Kaagaz Ke Phool with a bad review, and in the process, \"kills\" the filmmaker\\'s career? But on the other hand, Amitabh Bachchan, in a cameo, says, \"Critiquing is a must for society.\" He is kinda-sorta saying what Malcolm X said: “If you have no critics, you’ll likely have no success.”   The serial killer knows this. He or she is not against criticism, per se. They are only against those critics who fake reviews with false star ratings, or trash films in unkind language. I think what Balki (along with the serial killer) is saying is this: Criticise all you like, but do it honestly, ethically, responsibly. This may be the closest this director has come to a “message movie,” and also the closest he’s come to showcasing his all-out, arms-outstretched love for cinema. There is practically no background score except for the temple blocks sound that punctuated Jane kya tune kahi, from Pyaasa. The heroine is film-crazy, too. How does she know she’s in love? When someone comes running towards her, in slow motion. Danny is a florist, and his tulips inspire her to hum that famous tulip-filled song from Silsila.  The film’s most controversial statement is a poster in Nila’s house that says “Woody Allen is innocent,” which could be extrapolated to the art being separate from the artist.    Dulquer is cast against type, and it works brilliantly. He’s alternately melancholic, romantic, moody, awkward, weird – and all these emotions play off nicely against Shreya’s girl-next-door charm. They seem mismatched in most ways, but their abundant love for cinema (which may be greater than their love for each other) brings them together. Against this pair, we have Sunny Deol. It’s a great comeback, and he’s super-effective as a cop who’s about as romantic as a pack of cards. The one big name in the cast that did not work for me was Pooja Bhatt, who plays a criminal psychologist who specialises in psychopaths. With Sunny’s character doing most of the crime-solving work, this role seems redundant. By the time she makes an appearance, we have almost all the information we need. Maybe the character should have been worked into the screenplay earlier. Only in the last portions does the film falter. These are the “explanation” portions, something like the ending of Hitchcock’s Psycho, and they seem rushed. Or put another way, perhaps these portions would not have seemed so rushed had we seen more of this side of the killer earlier. The decision to separate the investigation and the romance is a clever idea, but perhaps there’s too much separation – a little more intertwining of these threads, a few more clues scattered earlier, may have made the two-track narrative more one-of-a-piece. I am not asking for that cat-and-mouse game – just a little more interplay between the cop and the killer. Anyway, I cannot say any more. And this final stretch apart, Chup is an entertaining, engaging and cautionary meta-tale about how words matter, and why criticism is not just about writing witty prose or awarding stars. It’s a serious affair, as serious as cinema. You could say, it’s a matter of… life and death.\\n\\t13. Season 1 of Delhi Crime was about the gang rape case of 2012, which occurred in Delhi. But it was equally about what it\\'s like to be a police officer. DCP Vartika, played by Shefali Shah, says these words: \"One third of Delhi\\'s population lives in unauthorised slums and serves the elite, who earn the highest per capita income in India. Policing a city like this one is a complex task…\" In other words, Season 2 is more of the same. You have to face the media, which will do anything for ratings, including the reveal of footage being used in an investigation. You have to face the public, which sometimes wants vigilante justice ASAP. You have to face your higher-ups, who say impossible things like \"I want an answer in 24 hours\". But most of all, you have to face your family, the one that rarely sees your face.  One of the most striking images in Season 2 is that of the Rasika Dugal character telling her husband that his breakfast is ready, while in uniform. As for Vartika, she faces a daughter who thinks she is controlling and yet is proud of her achievements. Rajesh Tailang wants to get his daughter married off, and is looking for ways to kickstart the process behind her back. It\\'s a testament to this excellent cast – right down to the junior artists and guest stars like Tilottama Shome – that we care deeply about every single one of them. A cop in Vartika\\'s team thinks she is leaving them and begins to make a speech about how she has always treated them like family. The scene is a joke and we laugh, but we also get how sincere and how grateful the cop was. You\\'d be sincere and grateful, too, if your work family was this supportive, almost making up for the family you leave behind for hours and days at a stretch. The first image of Season 2 is that of Vartika\\'s face. She\\'s in her car, and the composed authority we usually see is replaced by a defeated expression. She looks as though she\\'s seen a ghost. As great as the other actors are – especially Rasika Dugal and Rajesh Tailang – the face of Delhi Crime is the face of Shefali Shah. It\\'s the quiet assurance when she tells the daughter of a brutally murdered couple, \"You don\\'t want to see their faces. That is not the last memory you want to carry with you.\" It\\'s the way she gently but forcefully puts a bigot in his place. (This man is a former cop and he has been summoned for help with a case.) It\\'s the way she receives the big news at the end, which makes us wonder what Season 3 will look like.  Tanuj Chopra is the director, and over five episodes, he and his writers expertly take us through the investigation of a series of murders in upscale neighbourhoods. Along with a ton of procedural detail – I was reminded of Rajeev Ravi\\'s recent Malayalam movie, the excellent Kuttavum Shikshayum – we get to look at the case from a ton of angles. Take this breakfast conversation between Vartika and her husband. He says Delhi has only x number of policemen per lakh of people, and it sounds like a bit of \"look we did all this research\" fact-dropping. But the writing instantly fills this dry fact with emotion that reveals a facet of personality. When he adds that Vartika, therefore, cannot solve each crime, she replies, \"Even if I stop one crime, it\\'s worth it.\" Or take this exchange with Bhupinder, the Rajesh Tailang character. Vartika asks him a rhetorical question. What are we doing wrong? Why isn\\'t the crime rate decreasing? The ever-practical Bhupinder turns this bit of existential hand-wringing into dry fact. \"Well, where is the time to think about this? Even before we begin thinking, another crime happens.\" These slow detours flesh out the inevitable race-against-time aspects of the series. And the detours are not always about these cops. It is also about the city and its people, like the denotified tribes that come under suspect. There\\'s a moral dimension here. The entire group is under suspicion just because they are underprivileged. As a lawyer asks, \"During the Harshad Mehta scam, was everyone named Mehta thrown into jail?\" The language, too, adds to the authenticity. Unlike Hindi films, Delhi Crime uses the mix of Hindi and English beautifully. \"I am very sorry to put you through this but beta aapne jo bataya it\\'s going to be a great help to the case.\" Or, \"Yeh jo CCTV footage leak hua hai it\\'s a very serious matter.\" The lines sound so clean and organic. There are very few flaws, but if I had to nitpick, I\\'d point to the scene where Vartika says that there are no \"born criminals\". This claim comes full circle at the end, when we get a psychological explanation for the crime from the criminal. But it feels too pat, too reductive for a show as complex as this one. (Maybe I wouldn\\'t have felt this way if this had played out over a longer stretch of time.) Also, the gut-wrenching impact of Season 1 is missing, but that cannot be helped. The Nirbhaya case was so primally disturbing that its aftermath encompassed a nation. The crime here is more of a kind with Hollywood genre pieces. But like I said, this is just nitpicking. Season 2 of Delhi Crime is a worthy addition to one of the finest shows – not just on Indian television but anywhere.\\n\\t14.  If Martin Scorsese and Timothy Dalton\\'s James Bond had a baby, it would be something like Vikram. This is a drug-filled gangster movie, filled wall-to-wall with fantastic rock-music riffs, courtesy Anirudh. This is a grim saga about secret agents who sacrifice a great deal to save the world, paying a high personal cost. This is also Lokesh kanagaraj\\'s purest movie to date. During Master, there was talk about the film being 50% Vijay, 50% Lokesh Kanagaraj. Vikram is 100% Lokesh, while also being a 100% Kamal Haasan movie. It is not just about the fanboy, easter-egg references like the name Stephen Raj (Vetri Vizha) or Prabanjan (Kamal Haasan\\'s writer-friend) or the umbrella shot from Sathya or the play on the most famous lines from Nayakan and Kuruthipunal. It is also that fantastic monologue about evolution, which seems plucked right out of Kamal Haasan\\'s screenwriting / dialogue-writing brain. The spirit of Kamal Haasan hovers over the film like a… Ghost. Vikram runs close to three hours and yet, there is very little flab. The half-hearted romance of Maanagaram - that\\'s not there. The prolonged \"family-friendly\" daughter sentiment from Kaithi - that\\'s not there. The hero-buildup college scenes from Master - that\\'s not there. Lokesh seems to have finally made exactly the movie he wanted to make - and he has Kamal Haasan to thank for that. This is an action movie – the first real genre-specific action film of Tamil cinema, where even the hero-introduction song (Pathala pathala) becomes a small part of the larger scheme of things (It finds context later in the narrative). The sentimental moments don\\'t kill the flow of the genre because they are not hammered home with \"scenes\". They are folded into the narrative in little bits. Plus, you get all the emotion you need from Kamal\\'s eyes or from Fahadh Faasil\\'s sly body language. Fahadh is fantastic – he manages the considerable feat of almost stealing a Kamal movie. At first, we seem to be watching a story about the hunt for masked murderers. But gradually, we see this is about something bigger. Lokesh does not make the mistake of moralising. He simply want us to feel what the stakes are if the good guys fail – and he lets us know that these bad guys really mean business. (There is a lot of collateral damage.) The screenplay demands close attention – there\\'s quite a bit of parallel narration. For example, we get a wife in danger and baby in danger – and we keep switching between the two tracks. It builds slowly and meticulously, adding micro-detail after micro-detail to a police procedural conducted by rogue cops, headed by the Fahadh character. And it cuts loose after the sensational interval block, becoming a full-fledged treat for action lovers, especially 80s/90s Hollywood action lovers. Anbariv is the action director. He stages the stunts in short bursts, and he uses tight spaces (corridors, stairways) very well. The devil is in the details. When a van hits a bike, the shot feels thrillingly real – which means that the cinematographer Girish Gangadharan and editor Philomin Raj have captured and cut this collision at exactly the right angle and speed. We also get more showy stretches, like the one where the camera thrusts in and out of the space where a masked man fights a number of enemies. Is Lokesh Kanagaraj building his own universe: the \"LKU\"? Because we have guns: small guns, bigger guns, and really big guns. We have characters from an orphanage. We have the endless nights – and some excellent night-scene choreography. And we have characters and the drug consignment from Kaidhi, which lead to a fantastic cameo by Suriya. This is the most electric the actor has been in years. You see in his eyes the madness you should have seen in NGK. There is not one bad performance in the bunch, and the writing adds lovely touches like Chemban Vinod Jose checking in on his bedridden father or a surprisingly agile domestic help or a gun-filled scene with Vijay Sethupathi and one of his wives. The dialogues, too, are simple and super-effective – like the lines Gayathrie Shankar utters after a disappointment. The only issue I had with Vikram is with Vijay Sethupathi\\'s villain. He gets a terrific entry scene and is called the \"ullooru Pablo Escobar\" and you expect great things from this character. But the writing is content to leave him a rather generic villain. It is left to the actor to add to the role more colour and flavour with his funky presence. And what about the big man himself? He has a ball. This is a self-aware movie, maybe even a meta-movie at some level. When Fahadh tells Kamal, \"I am a big fan of your work,\" or when Kamal echoes the lyrics of the title song of the earlier Vikram, there is some inevitable winking at the audience. But there is no fourth-wall breaking. The film is all of a piece, perfectly realised and a perfect tribute to a great genre and a great actor. Even when absent from screen, we feel his presence. Vikram is not just a fitting big-screen comeback for Kamal Haasan. Thanks to Lokesh and team, he finally has on his resumé the Vikram he wanted to make 36 years ago.\\n\\t15. Based on a real-life incident, Chidambaram’s Manjummel Boys – set in 2006 – tells the story of a group of friends that went to the Guna caves, where the superhit Ilayaraja song, ‘Kanmani anbodu’ was shot. (Another snatch of a Kamal Haasan-Ilayaraja song, Annatha aadurar, plays en route, in Palani.) One of this group falls into a deep pit, and while the locals say the guy is a goner, the friends refuse to lose faith. They came as a group. They will leave as a group. This is, thus, as much a survival drama as the story of undying friendship. The film can be compared to that other smash-hit survival drama, 2018. It is written in very broad strokes. For instance, it is not enough that a man is trapped in a pit. We also get horror stories about local beliefs about the pit, nicknamed Devil’s Kitchen. These stories are necessary – but they are not narrated casually. They are shot in an ultra-dramatic manner that hammers home extra layers of the dangers involved. It’s not enough that the shell-shocked friends rush to a police station for help. There has to be a cop in there who brandishes a stick and threatens to file an FIR on them for killing their friend and trying to pass the act off as an accident. Sushin Shyam’s unabashedly big score – solo violin and all – underlines the bigness of the telling. There are many individual moments that work. Soubin Shahir plays Kuttan, one of the oldest men in the group. As he descends into the jagged pit, we see how dangerous the fall must have been for the man who fell. There is an exquisitely poetic stretch that shows the friends as young boys playing hide-and-seek, which is the very “game” that will later be played out at the Guna cave. As the young boys play, the sunlit, bright-yellow frames of Manjummel transform to the chilly blues of Kodaikanal. The reason this stretch works so well is that it points to two things: one, the fact that someone is always getting into trouble and the others have to help him out, and two, we get a psychological portrait of a dream state. But when the second childhood flashback occurs, it’s redundant. It feels like the film is being padded out. In other words, we get a lot of uneven writing – but the “high” moments deliver such a high that most people may not care about what doesn’t work. I didn’t care for the frequent cutaways to the larger rock formations and hills. While these images reinforce the bigness of Nature (and our smallness in comparison), and also reinforce how dangerous this setting is, we keep getting distanced from the claustrophobia of the cave-situation.  The sentimental ending, too, goes on and on, much after the rescue, to hammer home the heroic nature of the hero. It is not enough that the man does a heroic deed – until the entire township acknowledges it and celebrates it. But the real heroes of the film are production designer Ajayan Chalissery and cinematographer Shyju Khalid. You don’t know where the sets end and where the real settings take over. And the visuals have just the balance of docu-drama and cinematic drama. If the idea was to convey the fact that “this really happened”, then mission accomplished. The screenplay is always playing to the audience. It believes in big, very obvious set-ups – as opposed to the smaller, more invisible set-ups in, say, Premalu, that have unexpected payoffs, like the bit about the pepper spray. And these big set-ups in Manjummel Boys are calculated to make you anticipate the payoffs – as opposed to the payoffs taking us by surprise. A man sees a piece of news in a torn bit of a newspaper, and his face fills up with an expression that makes the audience go: “What on earth did he read in that bit of newspaper!” And the pay-off happens at the end. Another set-up involves a very pointed conversation about God, who is described as a “light from above”. And we get this very image – a light from above – as a payoff. Why not have a more rambling conversation amongst all the friends, a conversation that happens to include God – as opposed to a two-line exchange that is specifically about God as a set-up, and that too with the very person who is going to be reminded of God? That way, we’d get more interaction between this bunch, and we’d also get a set-up that’s more… disguised. And why sentimentalise the rescued man as a god, because he has come back from the dead? This is the kind of bad, gallery-pleasing melodrama you expect in Tamil cinema, not Malayalam. But there’s no denying the mechanical efficiency of the end-result of this chain of set-ups and pay-offs. When the “light from above” moment happens, when that goosefleshy tug-of-war moment happens, when very specific lines from the Guna song play at the end of the ordeal (no spoiler there!), it works. It totally works. The rescue operation ends with an image that left me with tears. Soubin Shahir, as always, is marvellous – he has a way of embodying the ordinary with minimal fuss, even when his character is facing the most extraordinary situations. But the other actors don’t register much, because they are presented as a collective with a trait here, a trait there. For instance: at a wedding, Kuttan is the one who serves people their meals. He is the helper, while his friend won’t even serve water because he doesn’t want his clothes to get stained. Sreenath Bhasi plays the reckless one. We instantly know his fate. Because of this pointed “one trait per person” writing, the interpersonal relationships don’t come across well, and I was reminded of Sudani from Nigeria, where the bromance elements were far more convincing, far more moving. I wondered if – for narrative clarity alone – the number of people in the group could have been reduced. Because at least half this group ends up contributing very little to the proceedings. The most moving portion involving this group is the subtext. These are very ordinary men in very ordinary jobs. They are house painters, cab drivers, assistants in optometrist shops – they are single, and these occasional trips are the highlights of their lives. The inclusion of the Guna song, is thus, a masterstroke. It’s not just that the song was shot in the location where most of this movie takes place. It’s also that the all-consuming, almost divine flavour of romance in the song applies to this all-consuming, almost divine bromance between these men. That is why – despite its many flaws – Manjummel Boys works. I saw the film as a larger metaphor for the Malayalam film industry, whose movies have the longest “thank you card” stretches in Indian cinema. Unlike in other industries, where stars and technicians operate on their own, the people working in Malayalam cinema come across like a brotherhood, like their own version of “Manjummel Boys”. In this film alone, we see Khalid Rahman, the director of the gorgeous Anuraga Karikkin Vellam and Thallumaala, Unda and Love. He plays a supporting part, and his brother is this film’s cinematographer. The director of Driving License, Lal Jr., is another supporting actor here. The sense of camaraderie that exists in the Manjummel boys, that seems to exist in the industry, too. And that’s why – whether individual films work or not – the industry as a whole is thriving. That Guna song, perhaps, is an ode to this industry, which comes across as a fraternity in the truest sense of the word.\\n'"
