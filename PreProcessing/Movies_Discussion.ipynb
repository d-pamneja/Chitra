      "Title : Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, \n",
      " Synopsis : In 1980, Peter's father Ego visited Earth and fell in love with Peter's mother (Laura Haddock).In 2014, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) (The half-human, half-Celestial leader of the Guardians of the Galaxy who was abducted from Earth as a child and raised by a group of alien thieves and smugglers called the Ravagers), Gamora (Zoe Saldana) (A member of the Guardians and an orphan from an alien world who seeks redemption for her past crimes. She was trained by Thanos to be his personal assassin), Drax (Dave Bautista) (A member of the Guardians and highly skilled warrior in search for vengeance against Thanos for his family's slaughter), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) (A member of the Guardians who is a genetically modified raccoon bounty hunter and mercenary, who is also a master of weapons and military tactics), and Baby Groot (Vin Diesel) (A member of the Guardians who is a tree-like humanoid and the accomplice of Rocket) are renowned as the Guardians of the Galaxy.Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) (The golden High Priestess and the leader of the Sovereign people, a genetically engineered race who are \"gold and perfect and wanting to be physically and mentally impeccable), leader of the Sovereign race, has the Guardians protect valuable batteries from an inter-dimensional monster in exchange for Gamora's estranged sister Nebula (Karen Gillan) (An adopted daughter of Thanos who was raised with Gamora as siblings, and a reluctant member of the Guardians), who was caught attempting to steal the batteries.\n",
      "The Guardians stop the attack and kill the beast when Drax realizes that the hide of the beast is too thick to cut from the outside. He allows himself to be swallowed, so he can cut the beast from the inside. That does not work, and Gamora finds a weak spot on the skin and runs the sword from there to the entire length of its body, killing the beast and freeing Drax. The Guardians leave with Nebula.After the Sovereign find that Rocket stole some batteries for himself, the Sovereign attacks the Guardians ship with a fleet of drones. The drones are destroyed by a mysterious figure, but the Guardians crash-land on a nearby planet named Berhert. The figure reveals himself as Quill's father, Ego (Kurt Russell). He invites Quill, Gamora, and Drax to his home planet, while Rocket and Groot remain behind to repair the ship and guard Nebula.Ayesha hires Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) (A blue-skinned buccaneer who is the leader of the Ravagers, a fatherly figure to Quill, and member of the Guardians) and his crew, who have been exiled from the greater Ravager community for child trafficking, to recapture the Guardians.\n",
      "The Ravager community is led by Stakar, who had banished Yondu. Yondu claims that he didn't know that he was being used for trafficking kids.The Ravagers led by Yondu capture Rocket, but when Yondu hesitates to turn over Quill (by refusing to reveal Quill's location to the Sovereign and instead taking Rocket's offer of taking the batteries and selling them on the open market), whom he raised, his lieutenant Taserface (Chris Sullivan) leads a mutiny with help from Nebula. Taserface imprisons Rocket and Yondu aboard Yondu's ship and executes his loyalists.\n",
      "Nebula tricks Groot into freeing her, so she can help Rocket, but Nebula leaves to track down and kill Gamora, whom she blames for all the torture inflicted on her by their father, Thanos. Thanos would make Gamora and Nebula battle each other. And every time Nebula lost, he would replace one part of her with a robotic aperture, slowly and painfully turning her into a half machine. Hence, Nebula wants to kill Gamora and Thanos.\n",
      "While imprisoned, Rocket and Yondu bond. Rocket is curious as to why Yondu did not deliver Quill to Ego, but Yondu evades the question. Groot and Yondu's loyalist Kraglin (Sean Gunn) free Rocket and Yondu, and they destroy the ship and its crew as they escape, though not before Taserface warns the Sovereign.Ego, a god-like Celestial that manipulated the matter around its consciousness to form his \"home\" planet, explains that he projected a humanoid guise to travel the universe and discover a purpose, eventually falling in love with Quill's mother Meredith. Ego hired Yondu to collect the young Quill after Meredith's death, but the boy was never delivered, and Ego has been searching for his son ever since. He teaches Quill to manipulate their Celestial power. Nebula arrives at Ego's planet and tries to kill Gamora, but the pair reach an uneasy alliance when they discover caverns filled with skeletal remains.Ego reveals to Quill that in his travels he planted seedlings on thousands of worlds which can Terraform them into new extensions of himself, but they can only be activated by the combined power of two Celestials. To that end, he impregnated countless women and hired Yondu to collect the children but killed them all when they failed to access the Celestial power. Under the influence of Ego's power, Quill helps him activate the seedlings, which begin to consume every world. However, Quill fights back when Ego reveals that he caused Meredith's death due to the distraction she posed.Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Ego's naive Empath servant, grows close to Drax and warns him of Ego's plan. Gamora and Nebula also learn of the plan just as Rocket, Yondu, Groot and Kraglin arrive. The reunited Guardians reach Ego's brain at the planet's core and fight the Sovereign's arriving drones. Rocket makes a bomb using the stolen batteries, which Groot plants on Ego's brain. Quill battles Ego with his newfound Celestial powers in order to distract him enough to allow the other Guardians and Mantis to escape.The bomb explodes, killing Ego and disintegrating the planet. Yondu sacrifices himself to save Quill, who realizes that the reason Yondu kept him was to spare him from the fate of Ego's other progeny, and that Yondu was Quill's true \"daddy\". Having reconciled with Gamora, Nebula still chooses to leave and attempt to kill Thanos. The Guardians hold a funeral for Yondu, which is attended by dozens of Ravager ships, acknowledging Yondu's sacrifice and accepting him again as a Ravager.In a series of mid- and post-credit scenes:\n",

      "Title : Creed II, \n",
      " Synopsis : Three years after his loss to \"Pretty\" Ricky Conlan, Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) scores a string of victories, culminating in a victory over Danny \"Stuntman\" Wheeler (Andre Ward) to win the WBC World Heavyweight Championship. Now a worldwide star, Adonis proposes to his girlfriend, Bianca Taylor (Tessa Thompson), who agrees to marry him. When Bianca suggests starting a new life together in Los Angeles, Adonis is reluctant to leave his life in Philadelphia behind.Meanwhile, Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), a former Soviet boxer who killed Adonis' father, Apollo Creed, in the ring thirty-three years earlier, sees an opportunity to regain the glory that was taken from him as a result of his loss to Rocky Balboa in Moscow later that same year by pitting his son, Viktor Drago (Florian \"Big Nasty\" Munteanu) (with the assistance of Buddy Marcelle (Russell Hornsby), a promoter who has followed Viktor's career closely), against Adonis. When Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) refuses to support Adonis's decision to accept Viktor's challenge, Adonis, feeling betrayed, decides to leave for Los Angeles.Adonis and Bianca settle down in a luxurious apartment in Los Angeles close to Adonis's adoptive mother, and Apollo's widow, Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad). As Adonis and Bianca adjust to their new life on the West Coast and prepare for the upcoming match with Viktor, Bianca learns that she is pregnant. Adonis recruits Tony \"Little Duke\" Evers (Wood Harris), son of his father's trainer and later Rocky's trainer as Mickey's replacement. Overwhelmed with all the recent developments in his life, Adonis rushes into the match, getting himself badly injured. Viktor is disqualified for hitting Adonis while he is down allowing Adonis to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. Viktor becomes extremely popular in Russia and wins a series of fights given top billing.His body and ego shattered, Adonis becomes increasingly disconnected from Bianca. Mary Anne reaches out to Rocky in hopes of having him come to help Adonis out of his slump; Rocky arrives, he and Adonis make up, and Rocky agrees to train Adonis (with Little Duke) properly for a rematch against Viktor, who is suffering near-torturous levels of physical tests by his father. Bianca gives birth to a baby girl, and they name her Amara. Adonis and Bianca's fears are realized when their child is born deaf, inherited from her mother's progressive degenerative hearing disorder.While Viktor continues to taunt Adonis publicly, he is constantly pressured by his father to regain their honor. Ivan appears to be enjoying the attentions of the media and various Russian delegates, with which Viktor appears uncomfortable. At a State Dinner, he and Ivan meet Ludmilla (Brigitte Nielsen), his mother, and Ivan's ex-wife, for the first time in several years after she abandoned both of them after the loss to Rocky. Viktor is immediately enraged at the sight of his mother and chastises Ivan for his interactions with the people who outcast them. Back in America, Rocky and Little Duke take Adonis to a decrepit location in the California desert to retrain, describing it as a place where fighters are reborn. Adonis undergoes a rigorous and brutal training regimen with Rocky and Little Duke, focusing on fighting from the inside and training his body to repeatedly absorb the heavy impact he knows he will receive from Viktor in the ring.The rematch in Moscow is considerably more balanced as a more controlled and focused Adonis exchanges equal blows with Viktor. Since Viktor is accustomed to winning all of his fights by knockout, his fights have never lasted beyond the fourth round, something that Adonis uses to his advantage as he endures Viktor's punishment deeper into the match, even after his ribs break again. In the tenth round after being knocked down again, Adonis unleashes a furious rage, managing to land sequence after sequence of effective blows, knocking Viktor down twice. Ludmilla, who had been sitting ringside with some of Viktor's supporters, departs when the tide of the fight shifts in Adonis' favor, knocking Viktor off-balance emotionally.Ivan notes this as well, coming to terms with Viktor's earlier statements on the fair-weathered nature of the same supporters who had run Ivan out of Russia. With Viktor cornered and receiving multiple strikes without defending himself, but unwilling to go down, Ivan throws in the towel, conceding the fight to Adonis to ensure his son isn't seriously injured or killed. Though Viktor is ashamed, Ivan assures Viktor it is okay that he lost, and embraces him. As Bianca enters the ring to celebrate with Adonis and Little Duke, Rocky rescues himself from joining them, telling Adonis \"it's your time\", and takes a seat to watch them from outside the ring.Viktor and Ivan are later training together back in Ukraine. Rocky travels to Vancouver to make peace with his own estranged son, Robert (Milo Ventimiglia), and meets his grandson Logan for the first time, noting how much he looks like Adrian. Adonis visits Apollo's grave where he makes peace with his deceased father and the burden of carrying on his legacy, as he and Bianca introduce him to his granddaughter, who is sporting a new hearing aid.\n",

      "Title : Avengers: Infinity War, \n",
      " Synopsis : Having acquired the Power Stone from the planet Xandar, Thanos and his lieutenants- Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian, Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive intercept the spaceship carrying the survivors of Asgard's destruction. Thanos destroys the ship and kills all surviving Asgardians.As they extract the Space Stone from the Tesseract, Thanos subdues Thor, overpowers Hulk and kills Loki. With the Power Stone, even Hulk is no match for Thanos and is cowed into submission. Heimdall sends Hulk to Earth using the Bifrost before being killed. Thanos departs with his lieutenants and obliterates the spaceship. He instructs Maw & his lackeys to retrieve 2 Infinity Stones from Earth (the Time Stone with Dr. Strange and the Mind Stone with Vision) and meet him on Titan. Thanos's lieutenants duly arrive on Earth in their massive spaceship.Hulk crash-lands at the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to Bruce Banner. He warns Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos' plan to kill half of all life in the universe. In response, Strange recruits Tony Stark. Thanos used to attack each planet one by one, killing half the population, but found that the process was too slow and the problem too big. He knew that the Infinity Stones would give him the power to reshape the Universe and save life from itself. Though the attack on New York was led by Loki, it ordered by Thanos.The Big Bang created six elemental crystals, each of which controlled an essential aspect of existence which are: Time, Space, Reality, Mind, Power and Soul. He already has the Power and Space stones. Wong tells everyone that with the six Infinity Stones in his possession, Thanos can control the universe itself by simply snapping his fingers.Vision has the Mind Stone, but he has turned off his tracker. Only Rogers can find Vision and he and Tony haven't spoken since the Avengers disbanded. Hulk tells Tony to bury his differences with Captain America, since Thanos is coming to Earth, no matter whether they are talking or not. Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing the attention of Peter Parker. Bruce is unable to convert into Hulk, who was traumatized by the fight he lost to Thanos. Maw captures Strange but fails to take the Time Stone due to an enchantment Strange has placed on the amulet the stone is housed in. Stark and Parker pursue Maw's spaceship, Banner contacts Steve Rogers, and Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum.On the spaceship Parker and Stark defeat Maw by blasting out a part of the ship's hull and sucking Maw into open space. Dr. Strange is worried about the Time Stone falling into Thanos' hands and wants to return to Earth. Stark disagrees, believing that the best way to defeat Thanos is by engaging him away from Earth. The spaceship is on auto-pilot and Stark reckons that it will take them where Thanos is or is going to be. They agree to pursue Thanos, but Dr. Strange warns Stark that he would sacrifice him and Parker both, if that would protect the stone.In Scotland, Midnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff and Vision in order to retrieve the Mind Stone from Vision. Rogers, Natasha Romanoff and Sam Wilson rescue them and take shelter with James Rhodes and Banner at the Avengers Compound. Vision offers to sacrifice himself by having Maximoff destroy the Mind Stone to keep Thanos from retrieving it. Rogers suggests they travel to Wakanda, which he believes has the resources to remove the stone without destroying Vision.The Guardians of the Galaxy respond to a distress call from the Asgardian ship and rescue Thor who was floating frozen in deep space. Thor learns that Gamora is Thanos' daughter and that he is linked romantically to Quill. Thor surmises Thanos seeks the Reality Stone, which is in the possession of the Collector on Knowhere. Gamora wants to go to Knowhere to stop Thanos, but Thor wants to go to Nidavellir to obtain a new weapon after his sister Hela destroyed his hammer, Mjolnir. Undecided, they split into 2 teams. Gamora remembers how Thanos attacked her planet and killed half the population. He adopted Gamora, after he found her standing up to him. Thanos gifts her a perfectly balanced knife. Gamora makes Quill promise her that if Thanos captures her that he will kill her.Rocket and Groot accompany Thor to Nidavellir, discovering that Thanos had already been there. He'd forced the dwarves there to forge his gauntlet and then killed everybody and also smelted the hands of the chief dwarf, Eitri, while sparing his life. Thor, Rocket and Eitri create a battle-ax (Stormbreaker) capable of killing Thanos. Thor kick starts the star to power the furnaces, a process that nearly kills him, and Groot provides the handle for the new weapon. Stormbreaker can also control the power of the Bifrost.On Knowhere, Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax and Mantis find Thanos with the Reality Stone already in his possession. Thanos uses the stone to twist reality and tricks Gamora into thinking that she attacked and killed him. Back in reality, Thanos kidnaps Gamora, his adoptive daughter. Quill is unable to kill Gamora as he hesitates and by then Thanos changes reality again and uses the Space Stone to take Gamora to his ship. Thanos argues that ever since he eliminated half the population on Gamora's planet, the children have are well-nourished and enjoy a healthier world. The Universe has finite resources and life, if left unchecked, will consume itself. Thanos insists that he is the only one who understands this and will do what is needed to save the Universe.Thanos reveals that Nebula was captured when she snuck aboard Thanos' ship to kill him. She has been held in a chamber where Thanos uses the Power and Space stones to torture her. Gamora tearfully reveals the location of the Soul Stone. Thanos and Gamora travel to Vormir, where Red Skull, keeper of the Soul Stone, informs him the stone can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone he loves. Thanos reluctantly throws Gamora off a cliff, killing her and earning the stone.Nebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Thanos' desolate home world, Titan. Stark, Parker and Strange land on Titan where they are attacked by Quill, Drax, and Mantis, who give up the fight when they realize who the Avengers are. The group forms a plan to seize the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos after Strange uses the Time Stone to view millions of possible futures, seeing only one in which Thanos loses.Thanos arrives and speaks to Strange, justifying his plans as necessary to ensure the survival of a universe threatened by overpopulation. The group works together to subdue him and are successful. Quill demands to know where Gamora is. Nebula deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora. Enraged, Quill attacks him, allowing Thanos to break the psychic hold Mantis had placed on him. Thanos is able to break free and battle with him again. Thanos is able to overpower them all using the stones, finally confronting Stark himself. Stark is seriously wounded by Thanos but is spared after Strange surrenders the Time Stone to Thanos. Stark is infuriated and puzzled as to why Strange would do so.In Wakanda, Rogers reunites with Bucky Barnes before Thanos' army invades. The Avengers, alongside T'Challa and the Wakandan forces, mount a defense against Thanos's army while Shuri, T'Challa's sister, works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Banner, unable to transform into the Hulk, fights in Stark's Hulkbuster armor. Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive via the Bifrost to reinforce the Avengers; Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive are killed, and their army is routed. Thanos arrives and swiftly defeats defeats the remaining Avengers. Despite Maximoff's successful destruction of the Mind Stone and Vision along with it, Thanos uses the Time stone to reverse the event, brings Vision back and tears the stone from his head, killing him again.Thanos places the last stone in the gauntlet and absorbs the sudden rush of power from all six stones. Temporarily distracted, Thanos is attacked by Thor, who embeds Stormbreaker in the Titan's chest. Thor gloats for a moment but is taunted by a dying Thanos, who tells him he should have aimed for his target's head. Thanos raises the gauntlet and snaps his fingers with a sudden burst of white light. Thanos finds himself on an empty landscape covered with a thin layer of water, contained in the world of the Soul stone. At a nearby temple, he meets Gamora, who appears as a child the same age as when Thanos attacked her planet. She innocently asks him if he was able to complete his life's goal and he answers \"Yes\". She asks him what it cost and he says \"Everything.\"Back in Wakanda, Thor, staring at Thanos with dawning horror, demands to know what the Titan did. Thanos, burned from the gauntlet to his chest and neck, remains silent and uses the battered gauntlet to escape with the Space stone.Half of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Maximoff and Wilson who all turn to ash on Earth. On Titan, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange and Parker all turn to ash as well. Stark and Nebula remain stranded on Titan while Banner, M'Baku, Okoye, Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, and Thor are left alive on the Wakandan battlefield.Meanwhile, Thanos watches a peaceful sunrise on a remote, tropical world, smiling to himself.In a post-credits scene Nick Fury and Maria Hill watch several cars collide and a helicopter crash into a skyscraper. Hill asks what's going on and disintegrates. Fury's last act is to activate a small transmitter, which displays a starburst insignia on a red-and-blue background.\n",

      "Title : Avengers: Endgame, \n",
      " Synopsis : In 2018 Clint Barton, who is under house arrest following his actions during the Avengers Civil War, guides his daughter Lila in archery at his homestead while his wife Laura and his two sons prepare a picnic. Suddenly, vanishes into ash, leaving a panicked Clint alive and alone.Three weeks since Thanos decimated half the universe's population with a snap of his fingers, Tony Stark and Nebula are adrift in space on the Benatar, their fuel and supplies dwindling. As Stark, still injured from his fight with Thanos and close to starving to death, records a message for his fiancée Pepper Potts in preparation for his demise, Carol Danvers locates the spaceship and brings them back to Earth. Stark reunites with Potts, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner and James Rhodes; Rocket Raccoon joins Nebula as they mourn the fall of their fellow Guardians of the Galaxy. Stark furiously confronts Rogers accusing him of being the one who disbanded the Avengers and as a result they were unable to stand united during their conflict with the Mad Titan. He questions why the Avengers only do their best after the worst has already come to pass. Tony passes out due to exhaustion. With a tip from Nebula about her father's location, along with a Snap-like energy signature that was detected two days prior, the team head into space for the Garden, intending to take the Infinity Stones back and reverse the destruction.They discover Thanos, now horribly scarred, alone and undefended cooking a meal. They launch an ambush, quickly pinning him down and cutting off the arm wearing the Infinity Gauntlet. It has been emptied of its Stones. Thanos reveals that he had destroyed them using their own powers, which nearly killed him, as he considered his work done and wanted to remove the temptation of using them again. Although suspected of lying by Rhodes, Nebula vouches for her father, as he is never a liar. Surprised with the affirmation, Thanos reconsiders his torturous treatment of his daughter, but he is then immediately beheaded by Thor. Although the Mad Titan is dead, they have failed to accomplish their mission of resurrecting his victims and have no choice but to accept defeat.Five years pass, and the surviving population have yet to cope with their losses. Rogers now runs a support group for people to try help them come to terms with what happened. Stark and Pepper Potts are now married and are living in a remote cabin with their daughter Morgan. In San Francisco, Scott Lang escapes from the Quantum Realm when a rat activates controls left behind by the van Dyne family before they vanished. Lang wanders through the disheveled city and realizes something terrible has happened. He approaches the Wall of the Vanished, a massive memorial containing the names of everyone in the city who vanished in the Snap. He frantically searches it hoping to not find Cassie's name, only to find his own (as no-one remaining knew what happened to him). Scott rushes to Cassie's house and finds that she is now a teenager. Father and daughter tearfully reunite.At the Avengers Compound, Romanoff now commands the the team as they perform various assignments. Rhodes informs her of a recent Mexican cartel massacre carried out by Barton, expressing his concern over how far their former comrade had fallen. Lang arrives at the compound and reveals to Romanoff and Rogers that although five years had passed, he only spent five hours in the realm. He proposes that they could find a way to exploit the realm's time-bending nature to travel into the past and retrieve the Stones from different times. But since the three have no knowledge of quantum physics, they seek out Stark.Initially declining to help them, as he believes it would mean putting his daughter Morgan in danger of being erased from existence, Stark later decides to spring into action after coming across an old photo of him and his late protégé Peter Parker. He successfully develops a time-space GPS device based on an inverted Möbius strip. Stark consults with Potts on his new discovery, who encourages him to do what's right for everyone else. Meanwhile, the other Avengers recruit Banner, who merged his intellect with Hulk's physique, to run time travel tests on Lang using the quantum tunnel housed in his van. The experiment does not turn out as expected, as Lang constantly shifts between different ages. Afterward, Stark arrives at the facility with the GPS and returns Rogers' shield to him, signifying their reconciliation, but makes it clear he won't sacrifice his daughter to undo what Thanos did. Rogers agrees.The remaining Avengers begin to regroup. As Nebula returns to New York, Banner and Rocket travel to New Asgard and recruit Thor, who has become an overweight, depressed and lazy drunkard, traumatized with his perceived failure to stop Thanos. Romanoff goes to Tokyo and finds Barton, who has massacred a group of Yakuza as part of his vengeful crusade against criminals who survived the Snap. Rocket and Stark build a time machine, while Barton volunteers to submit himself for a test run into the past. Grabbing a baseball mitt from his homestead, he successfully carries it back to the present as evidence that their plan works.The Avengers plan out their Time Heist, using points from their past to pinpoint locations for the Infinity Stones: the Space, Mind, and Time Stones are found in 2012 New York, the Reality Stone in 2013 Asgard, and the Power and Soul Stones on Morag and Vormir respectively in 2014. They split into three teams and travel back in time to begin their missions, mindful that they only have a finite amount of Pym Particles since Hank Pym also perished in the Snap.Rogers, Stark, Banner and Lang arrive in an alternate 2012 in the midst of the Battle of New York. Banner approaches the New York Sanctum and finds the Ancient One, who refuses to lend the Time Stone to him. However, she relents after learning that Doctor Strange had surrendered it to Thanos in the future, knowing Strange wouldn't have done so if there wasn't a grave reason. At Stark Tower, Lang and Stark attempt to steal the Tesseract, but loses it to Loki, who uses it to teleport away. Rogers obtains the Scepter from STRIKE possession by feigning HYDRA affiliation, but is forced to fight his 2012 self who confuses him for Loki. After defeating his past self, Rogers rendezvous with Stark and Lang.With only enough Pym Particles for one more trip each, Stark and Rogers decide to go back further to Camp Lehigh to an alternate 1970, where they have another shot at obtaining the Tesseract and more Pym Particles. Lang is left with the Scepter to return to the present day. At the S.H.I.E.L.D. base, Rogers stealthily obtains the Particles from Hank Pym, but runs into Peggy Carter's office while evading security. He tearfully watches her as she works in her office. Meanwhile, Stark encounters his father Howard after obtaining the Tesseract. With the latter's wife Maria expecting a baby, Tony (under the guise of \"Howard Potts\") offers parenting advice, saying that the good times he had with his father are all that mattered. Before they part ways, Tony hugs his alternate father, having finally obtained his closure.Arriving on Asgard in an alternate 2013, Thor experiences a panic attack after seeing his mother Frigga, recalling this is the day of her demise. Rocket encourages him to settle his grief and help him extract the Aether from Jane Foster's body, but Thor runs away, leaving the raccoon to do it himself. Thor unsuccessfully attempts to hide from Frigga and runs into her, who knows that her alternate son is from the future. Sharing a talk, Frigga lectures her son on the importance of failure, advising him to follow his own path rather than try and live up to what he was supposed to be. Thor attempts to warn his mother about her impending death, but she silences him. As Rocket returns with the Aether in hand, Thor shares one last hug with Frigga before reaching out to retrieve Mjølnir, finding that he remains worthy of wielding the hammer.In an alternate 2014, Barton and Romanoff board the Benatar for Vormir, while Nebula and Rhodes remain on Morag and wait for Peter Quill to arrive and lead them to the Orb's chamber. They knock Quill out and collect the Stone, but when the two attempt to travel back, Nebula is left behind when her memories are entangled with those of her past self. The Thanos of that time uses the link to see into the future, learning that the same humans who had foiled his 2012 invasion are returning to reverse his ultimate victory. Determined to know more, Thanos captures Nebula as she attempts to warn Barton and Romanoff of his newfound involvement. Past Nebula confronts her future self and collects her GPS and Pym Particles, handing it over to her father.Meanwhile, Barton and Romanoff arrive on Vormir. They meet Red Skull, who informs them that the sacrifice of a loved one must be carried out in order for one to retrieve the stone. Barton laughs at the concept, but Romanoff deduces that it is indeed the truth, as Thanos had murdered his daughter Gamora there in their time. Understanding the severity of the situation, the two struggle to decide who should give their life for the cause; while Barton insists he should do it due to the carnage he left behind in the wake of his grief, Romanoff declares that her life's work has led her to this moment. As they dash to the cliff, they wrestle to keep each other away from sacrificing themselves. Ultimately, Romanoff makes the jump and dies, leaving the Soul Stone with the grief-stricken Barton.The Avengers return to the present day. Reeling from the loss of one of their own, they realize that her death cannot be undone, and that their efforts to save the universe must not leave her death in vain. They construct a new gauntlet using Tony's Mark suit technology and load the six Stones onto it. Thor volunteers to perform the snap, but Banner steps in, saying he's the only one strong enough to withstand the Stones' radiation, which is gamma in nature, similar to his own. While severely scarring his arm, he successfully snaps his fingers and brings the victims of the Snap back to life. Elsewhere, Past Nebula - who traveled to the present in place of her future self - opens the Avengers' time portal, allowing Thanos to bring his ship, the Sanctuary II, forward from 2014. The Avengers barely have time to celebrate their success when the ship abruptly opens fire on the compound with a barrage of missiles, levelling the facility to rubble.As Thanos sends Past Nebula to retrieve the Stones, her future self reveals to Gamora that their relationship in the future became one of friendship and more. Gamora decides to join Nebula to stop her father. Meanwhile, Rhodes, Rocket and Banner are trapped in a flooding area under the rubble, forcing Lang to come and save them. Barton lands next to the gauntlet in the sewer, which is infested with Outriders. After escaping them, he unknowingly passes the apparatus to Past Nebula, who is then confronted by Gamora and Nebula; the latter kills her past self once she threatens her sister. Stark, Rogers and Thor confront Thanos on the ground, who intends to rebuild the entire universe using the Stones, a universe where the new living beings will live in peace without knowledge of the past.

However, Thanos eventually defeats Rogers, severely injuring him and nearly destroys his shield with his sword.Thanos summons the rest of his army, which include the Chitauri and the Black Order, to lay siege on Earth. Just as Rogers prepares to face them alone, he hears Sam Wilson contacting him through his earpiece. A series of sling ring portals appear behind him. The Masters of the Mystic Arts have arrived with reinforcements from Kamar-Taj, Wakanda, Contraxia and New Asgard, along with the Avengers' resurrected allies from Wakanda, Titan and San Francisco.

With the scales now balanced, Rogers calls for the Avengers to assemble and leads his allies into the battle for the fate of the universe.Banner tells Barton that they must get the Stones back to their respective times and away from Thanos. With their main time machine destroyed in the initial attack, their only other option is the van; Ant-Man and Wasp jump to hot-wire the dead vehicle. As Thanos' forces close in on Barton. he passes the gauntlet onto Black Panther. As Thanos prepares to charge at T'Challa, he suddenly finds his path blocked by a vengeful Wanda Maximoff, seeking revenge for his 2018 self's murder of Vision. As Wanda engages Thanos, T'Challa runs, only to become entrapped by Ebony Maw. Seeing T'Challa's predicament, Spider-Man swoops in and snatches the gauntlet.Meanwhile, Wanda's attacks leave Thanos at her mercy, as she effortlessly breaks his sword and lifts him into the air, the whole time ripping chunks of armor from his body. In order to escape her grasp, Thanos orders another missile barrage from Sanctuary II (against Corvus Glaive's protests) that deals great damage to both sides. One of the missiles takes out a dam, forcing Doctor Strange out of the fight to prevent the battlefield from flooding.Suddenly, Sanctuary II redirects its fire to an object arriving from outer space. It was Carol Danvers, who comes to single-handedly destroy the warship. Retrieving the gauntlet from Parker, she enlists the aid of her fellow female combatants as she dashes to the now-activated van. However, Thanos uses his sword to destroy the vehicle and the quantum portal. With the gauntlet in Thanos' reach, Stark, Rogers, Thor and Danvers make their last stand to keep it out of his hands. However, he manages to shake all of his opposition aside and equip the gauntlet. Strange informs Stark that this is the one future that ends in their victory. Determined, Stark dashes at Thanos one last time, but he is knocked aside as the Titan snaps his fingers. Nothing happens, as the Stones have been stolen by Stark and transferred onto his suit. With the very being that has haunted him for the past eleven years now at his mercy, Stark snaps his own fingers.Thanos watches in horror as his own forces crumble to dust in front of him, only to meet that same fate soon after.

After the reception, Christian takes Ana straight to their honeymoon by flying on his private jet to visit Europe, where they naturally consummate. Christian remains protective of Ana when they are at the beach and she is sunbathing topless, concerned that other men will try to make a move on her. Christian takes her back to their room, where more kinky sex ensues.Back at Grey Enterprises, a man is seen going to the company's data center to plant a bomb. Christian's assistant contacts him and informs him that there was a minor fire but nothing serious.

He also hires an assistant, Mrs. Jones (Fay Masterson), to help around the house, but Ana says she wants to cook Christian dinner. During their dinner, Ana makes a joke about being pregnant, which appears to make Christian uncomfortable. She asks if he does want kids, and he says maybe someday.Ana returns to work at SIP where she is promoted to the senior editor position, though she feels that people will think she only got it thanks to Christian. He visits Ana while she meets with a writer, Boyce Fox (Tyler Hoechlin), with the implication that he is jealous, and he is also upset that Ana still uses her maiden name at work and not Grey.Christian takes Ana to a house he bought away from the city for the two of them. They meet with the architect, Gia Matteo (Arielle Kebbel), who comes off as very flirty with Christian. Ana notices and very assertively tells Gia to back off and to pick a new design for the house.\n",
      "On their way back to the city, Christian's bodyguard Taylor (Max Martini) informs him that someone is following them. Ana drives the car into the city and manages to evade the driver. They pull over somewhere and begin to have sex. Ana thrusts Christian very vigorously as he climaxes with no condom on.Later, they review surveillance pictures of the driver, which appears to be a woman and not Jack. Christian orders his people to dig up everything they can on Jack. Afterwards, Ana offers to cut Christian's hair. When she goes to find scissors in his desk, she finds a gun in there. Christian tells her it belonged to Leila Williams (the woman that stalked them), and he didn't turn it in to the police because he didn't want Leila to get into more trouble than she was already in.Ana goes out for a drink with Kate (Eloise Mumford), despite Christian wanting her home soon. Kate mentions that Elliot (Luke Grimes) said that police found a number of files on Jack's computer of the Grey family, which Christian never told Ana. Before going home, Ana notices she has six missed calls from Christian, but Sawyer told him where Ana was. When she gets home, Jack appears in her room and holds a knife to her throat, attempting to kidnap her. Sawyer and Prescott intervene and take Jack down before the police arrive.After the incident, Christian is distant from Ana, as he felt he couldn't protect her because he didn't know where she was. He brings her into his pleasure room for some BDSM but he only teases her as a means of punishing her for breaking their trust. Christian says he was fearful because he dreamed that Ana was dead and that he blamed himself for not being able to help her.To reconcile, Christian surprises Ana with a trip to Aspen with Kate, Elliot, Mia (Rita Ora), and Jose (Victor Rasuk). Upon arriving at their house, Christian plays the piano and starts to sing, which Elliot and Mia say they have never heard him do.

Soon, they start licking the ice cream off of each other before getting down to the business.While out dress-shopping with Kate and Mia, Ana notices Elliot out on the streets with Gia, whom Christian had mentioned was an ex-girlfriend of Elliot's. Later that night, the group attends a club where Elliot proposes to Kate, and she accepts. It turns out Gia was just helping Elliot find the perfect ring.After the vacation, Ana is visited at work by a detective working on the case against Jack. He is set for a bail hearing that afternoon, and he is telling the authorities that he and Ana had a fling that he broke off, leading her to react angrily and get him fired by making up the assault story. Ana attends the bail hearing where the judge grants Jack bail at $500,000 due to his previously clean record. As he is being escorted out, he makes a smug face at Ana.Ana visits the doctor and finds out she is pregnant.

She sees his phone receive a text from Elena Lincoln (his former mistress). Ana sleeps in the pleasure room, feeling betrayed. The two of them argue about it in the morning, with Ana suggesting that if she has to, she will leave Christian for the sake of their child.At work, Ana receives a call from Mia's phone. However, it's Jack, who was released on bail, and he is holding Mia hostage with the demand that Ana bring him $5 million within less than two hours, and if she tells Christian, Jack will return Mia in pieces.Ana goes to the bank to withdraw the money. Christian calls her after hearing about this and thinks that Ana is trying to leave her, but she cannot explain herself. Jack calls Ana again and tells her he knows Christian is arriving at the bank because he has a driver outside the bank keeping an eye out. He orders Ana to give the driver her phone when she gets there. Ana gets the money but borrows the phone of one of the tellers. Before Christian can get to Ana, she is already getting in the car with the driver, Liz (Amy Price-Francis), an assistant from work that slept with Jack and is being blackmailed by him since he taped them. Sawyer informs Christian he saw Ana get in Liz's car and that she threw Ana's phone out, but it turns out Ana hid her own phone in the money bag and is allowing Christian to track her phone.Ana arrives at the meet up with Jack. He proceeds to hit Ana and kick her in the stomach. Ana takes out Leila's gun and shoots Jack in the leg just as Christian and the cops arrive. Jack and Liz are arrested and Ana is taken to the hospital.In the hospital, Christian is by Ana's bedside with his mother Grace (Marcia Gay Harden).

Ana soon wakes up, and Christian goes to her with tears in his eyes.At home, Ana and Christian go over the case files on Jack. It turns out that Christian and Jack were both part of the same foster care group, and Christian wonders if he would have turned out like Jack if he didn't get adopted, but Ana assures him he wouldn't have. Ana also notices that the police found out where Christian's biological mother is buried.

He secretly dreams of becoming a musician like Ernesto de la Cruz, a popular actor and singer of Coco's generation. One day, Miguel inadvertently damages the photo of Coco with her parents at the center of the family ofrenda and removes it, discovering that her father (whose face is torn out) was holding Ernesto's famous guitar.Concluding that Ernesto is his great-great-grandfather, Miguel ignores his grandmother Elena's objections and leaves to enter a talent show for the Day of the Dead.

      "Title : Transformers: The Last Knight, \n",
      " Synopsis : In 484 AD, King Arthur's (Liam Garrigan) wizard Merlin (Stanley Tucci) forges an alliance with the Knights of Iacon, a group of twelve Transformers who have hidden on Earth. The Knights give Merlin an alien staff and combine into a huge dragon to help Arthur triumph over the Saxons.In the present day, most of the governments on Earth have declared Transformers outlawed, and the multinational Transformer Reaction Force (TRF) has been formed to destroy the alien robots. Despite the absence of Optimus Prime, who left the planet to search for his creator, new Transformers continue to arrive regularly; the newest ship to arrive crash-lands in the half of the ruins of Chicago, where it is found by a group of children. When a TRF Mecha confronts the kids, they are saved by Izabella (Isabela Moner), a survivor of the Battle of Chicago and her Transformer companions Sqweeks and Canopy, but Canopy is killed by the TRF in the process. Bumblebee and Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) arrive and help them escape, but Yeager is unable to save the Transformer in the ship. Before he dies, the knightly robot attaches a metallic talisman to Yeager's body-an act observed by Decepticon scout Barricade, who reports this to his leader, Megatron.On the far reaches of the Solar System, Optimus discovers that the Transformers' home world, Cybertron, now disassembled into pieces, is heading directly for Earth. He finds the being in control of Cybertron's movement, the sorceress Quintessa, who professes to be the maker he is searching for. The staff which the Knights stole from Quintessa and gave to Merlin. Quintessa wants to use the powers of the staff, she places Optimus under her control, dubs him \"Nemesis Prime\" and charges him with recovering it. Earth, she reveals, is actually Cybertron's \"ancient enemy\" Unicron and she intends to drain his life force so that Cybertron can be restored.\n",
      "Meanwhile giant horns start popping out at 6 locations on Earth. The Chinese call them \"The Horns from Hell\". NASA figures out that the horns are creating an inter-galactic dimension, through which the disintegrating Cybertron will enter in 3 days' time.TRF member and former Autobot ally William Lennox (Josh Duhamel) brokers a deal between the TRF and Megatron, releasing from their custody a squad of Decepticons that will help Megatron recover the talisman from Cade. William is ordered by his seniors to do the deal to ensure that the weapon, the \"staff\" is found by Megatron so that the US military (who has Megatron under surveillance) can retrieve the weapon. William is also ordered to reveal Yaeger's location to Megatron, since Yaeger has the talisman which will reveal the location of the staff.Megatron hunts Yeager down and follows him to his junkyard hideout in South Dakota, where he and many of the surviving Transformers are holed up. After the Decepticons retreat, Yeager is approached by Cogman, a Transformer envoy of British Lord Sir Edmund Burton (Anthony Hopkins), who takes him and Bumblebee to England to meet his master. There, Burton arranges a meeting between Yeager and Viviane Wembly (Laura Haddock), an Oxford professor. Wembly has just been kidnapped by the Autobot Hot Rod, using his long-term disguise as her Citroen DS.Burton explains that he is the last living member of the \"Witwiccan\" order, an ancient brotherhood dedicated to guarding the secret history of Transformers on Earth. He also reveals that Viviane is the last descendant of Merlin, and that she must find and use his Staff to prevent the impending destruction of Earth by Cybertron. He reveals that Merlin was given the staff by the Transformer knights, and it was fused with his DNA, which means that only a direct descendant of Merlin can operate the staff and wield its awesome power. The staff was buried with Merlin's body and was protected by the 12 alien knights.Fleeing the TRF, Yeager and Wembly follow clues left by the latter's father that led them, Bumblebee, and Cogman to take the submarine HMS Alliance into the sea to find the Cybertronian Knights' sunken ship, in which they discover the tomb of Merlin and the staff. Wembly activates the staff, and the ship rises to the surface; the TRF arrives to confront the group, but several Knights awaken and attack them. The attack is cut short by the arrival of the mind-controlled Optimus, and a battle between Optimus and Bumblebee ensues.At its peak, the normally-mute Bumblebee finally speaks, the sound of his voice proving enough to shock Optimus free of Quintessa's control. Taking advantage, Megatron, who is revealed to be conspiring for Quintessa all along, arrives and steals the staff. As he flees with it, the Knights attack Optimus. However, Yeager, whose talisman becomes the sword Excalibur, stops the fight. Realizing that he is the last Knight, the Knights yield to Yeager, who urges Optimus to protect the Earth once more.Megatron then delivers the staff to Quintessa, who begins draining the life force of Earth/Unicron via Stonehenge. When the British military intervenes, Megatron shoots Burton, who dies with Cogman at his side. Using a ship procured by the Autobot Daytrader, the Autobots arrive to join the fight, landing on Cybertron and battling against the Decepticons and Quintessa's Infernocons. Optimus and his Autobots, backed up by the Knights in their dragon form, vanquish their foes. Optimus sends Megatron flying from Cyberton back down to Earth, while Bumblebee shoots and apparently kills Quintessa. Viviane removes the staff, stopping Cybertron's destruction of Earth, destroying Cybertron in the process. Optimus declares that humans and Transformers must work together to rebuild their worlds and sends a message calling any surviving Autobots to come home.In a mid-credits scene, scientists inspect one of the horns of Unicron, which is extending out of the desert. Quintessa, who has survived and is disguised as a human, arrives and offers them a way to destroy Unicron.\n",

      "Title : The Lion King, \n",
      " Synopsis : The sun rises over the Pride Lands. Animals from all corners of the kingdom head over to Pride Rock (\"Circle of Life\"). The ruling lions King Mufasa (voice of James Earl Jones) and Queen Sarabi (voice of Alfre Woodard) are welcoming the birth of their cub, Simba. The mandrill high priest Rafiki (voice of John Kani) presents Simba before all the animals, and they all bow before the new prince.A little mouse is scurrying around his environment until he comes across the vicious Scar (voice of Chiwetel Ejiofor), Mufasa's jealous brother. Before he can devour the mouse, Scar is interrupted by Mufasa's hornbill major-domo Zazu (voice of John Oliver). He warns Scar that Mufasa is on his way to chastise him for missing out on the ceremony for Simba. Sure enough, Mufasa arrives to confront his brother, just as Scar is trying to make lunch out of Zazu. Scar expresses his dismay for not getting his place on the throne after Mufasa now that Simba is born. After Mufasa and Zazu leave, Scar looks on with scorn.Rafiki is by his tree, where he uses several bugs to form a drawing of Simba on the tree.Time passes, and Simba (now voiced by JD McCrary) is an eager and curious little cub. He wakes up his father so that he can explore the Pride Lands. Mufasa explains that everything in the Pride Lands is theirs, but anything beyond the borders is forbidden from venturing into. He also tells his son that they are connected in the great circle of life in regards to his duty as a future king. Zazu then flies in for the morning report before Mufasa teaches Simba how to pounce on the bird. Moments later, Zazu tells Mufasa that he has spotted hyenas. Mufasa orders Simba to go to Sarabi.Simba goes to Scar, who rests alone on his own little rock. As Simba expresses curiosity over what is beyond the borders of the Pride Lands, Scar tells him that it's an elephant graveyard. Simba then goes to find his best friend Nala (voice of Shahadi Wright Joseph), who is in the middle of a bath. Simba gets his own bath from Sarabi before he tells Nala that he wants to go to the watering hole, but Sarabi makes the cubs take Zazu as a chaperon.On their walk, Simba tells Nala where they are really going. Zazu notices them together and notes how cute it is to see two betrothed cubs together. This grosses out Simba and Nala, who insist they are only friends. Zazu says those are the rules, and Simba says he is going to change some of these rules when he becomes king (\"I Just Can't Wait To Be King\"). The cubs lose Zazu amidst the other animals before they head to the elephant graveyard. While exploring, they are found by a pack of hyenas, led by Shenzi (voice of Florence Kasumba), Kamari (voice of Keegan-Michael Key), and Azizi (voice of Eric Andre). Shenzi is ready to eat them once she realizes who Simba is, even as Zazu flies in to warn her that doing so would start a war with Mufasa. She attacks, but Zazu manages to hold her off long enough for Simba and Nala to run away. The pack then surrounds the cubs. Simba tries to roar at the hyenas but merely musters up simple growls. As they laugh and ask him to do it again, a louder roar is heard. Mufasa runs in and fights off the hyenas before ordering Shenzi to back off or face retribution. The hyenas retreat, but Mufasa is upset at Simba as he takes him and Nala home.Mufasa has Zazu take Nala home while he talks to Simba. He expresses his disappointment in him, but Simba tries to defend himself by saying that he was trying to be brave like Mufasa. He tells his son that he's only brave when he needs to be, and that he was afraid of losing Simba. They then sit to look up at the stars, and Mufasa tells Simba that the great kings of the past are looking down on them.The hyenas return to their hideout, complaining about their lack of food. It is then shown that Scar is leading them, and he deliberately led Simba and Nala to their path. He then tells the hyenas about his plan to kill Mufasa so that he will lead the Pride Lands (\"Be Prepared\"), and this will also mean more food for the hyenas.The next day, Scar brings Simba by a gorge to practice his roar. After he leaves Simba alone, he gives to hyenas the signal to make their move. Suddenly, Simba looks up at the cliff to notice a WILDEBEEST STAMPEDE. He runs for it and climbs up a tree for safety. Scar finds Mufasa and Zazu, warning his brother about Simba being trapped in the gorge while telling Zazu to alert the lionesses. Mufasa runs through the herd of wildebeest to reach Simba. He brings the cub up to safety but is dragged away by the wildebeest. Mufasa then starts climbing up the hill, only to be caught by Scar, who sinks his claws into Mufasa's paws. With a sinister look in his eyes, Scar tells Mufasa, \"Long live the king\", and he smacks his brother off the cliff to his demise. Simba watches helplessly as his father falls into the stampede. He runs down and discovers Mufasa's body, tearfully pleading with him to wake up. Scar finds Simba and says it's all his fault that his father is dead. Fearing for the consequences, Simba asks Scar what to do, and Scar orders him to run away and never return. After Simba does so, he sends Shenzi, Kamari, and Azizi (plus an unnamed hyena) to chase after Simba and kill him. Simba outruns the hyenas to the edge of a cliff where he and the fourth hyena fall over. Shenzi orders the other two to make sure Simba is dead, but they figure to themselves that he could not have survived the fall, and they are not eager to climb down and check. Simba is seen hiding before continuing his exile.Scar announces Mufasa's death to the lionesses, and then says that Simba was also killed. He feigns his grief before walking up to Pride Rock to assume his new duties as king, and then brings the hyenas out. Zazu and Rafiki watch from a distance and mourn Mufasa and Simba.Simba walks alone for miles before ending up in a desert. He collapses in exhaustion before a flock of vultures swoop in to try and eat him. They are interrupted by the meerkat-and-warthog duo Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen), who scare off the vultures before finding Simba. The two decide they should keep the cub so that when he grows into an adult lion, he will be on their side. Simba wakes up and is despondent, still blaming himself for his father's death. Timon and Pumbaa take him in and show him how they live their lives, according to their motto, \"Hakuna Matata\" (It means \"no worries!\"). Since the other animals are friends, Simba can't eat them and now feasts on bugs. He spends more time with Timon and Pumbaa, now growing into an adult (now played by Donald Glover).Under Scar's reign, the Pride Lands become devoid of sufficient food and resources, since the hyenas are bleeding everything dry. Nala (now voiced by Beyonce Knowles-Carter) expresses concern over how things have turned. Scar even tries to get Sarabi to be his queen, promising that she can dine with him, but she refuses. He then has the hyenas eat the rest of his kill, leaving barely scraps for the lionesses. Later that night, Nala tries to leave Pride Rock, but she is spotted by Zazu, who knows what Scar will do to her if he catches her leaving. Therefore, he creates a diversion to get Scar and the hyenas to chase him, allowing Nala to get away.After spending a day chowing down on grubs, Simba, Timon and Pumbaa lay down to look up at the stars. As Timon and Pumbaa muse over what could be up there, Simba mentions what Mufasa once told him about the kings of the past looking down on them. Timon and Pumbaa laugh it off, which bothers Simba. He goes to be alone, and as he lays down, some fur from his mane flies off. It is blown away and goes through a few animals before it finds its way to Rafiki. He senses that Simba is still alive, and he rejoices.Timon and Pumbaa are walking through their home while singing \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" before Nala attacks and chases after them. As they flee, Simba jumps out and pounces on Nala, but after she pins him down, he realizes who it is. Simba is excited to see his best friend again while Nala is elated that Simba is alive. The two go off together to catch up, leaving Timon and Pumbaa to realize that the two lions are becoming more than friends (\"Can You Feel The Love Tonight?\"). However, the happiness is short-lived once Nala tells Simba that he needs to return home due to what Scar and the hyenas have done. Still feeling guilty, he refuses to go back. Nala leaves him when he becomes too stubborn and doesn't listen to her.Simba wanders off alone until he is found by Rafiki. He tells Simba he knows Mufasa, and that he is alive. Simba follows Rafiki and is led to a lake. Rafiki makes Simba see his reflection, which turns into the image of Mufasa. Up in the clouds, Simba sees and hears Mufasa's voice as his face is illuminated by lightning. Mufasa knows that Simba has forgotten who he is, and therefore has forgotten his own father. He tells him to remember that he is the one true king. Now realizing his purpose, Simba runs off to catch up with Nala, and Timon and Pumbaa follow.The four make it to the Pride Lands and meet with Zazu, who is also happy to see Simba again. They see how bad the land looks, and why it is urgent that they stop Scar. Simba has Timon and Pumbaa be \"live bait\" to distract the hyenas and to let them get to Pride Rock. Simba sees Scar hurting Sarabi when she defies him again. Everyone is stunned to see Simba returning, and he goes by his mother's side. Scar tries to turn the tables on him by making Simba admit his guilt in Mufasa's death. Scar advances toward Simba, causing him to slip and hang over the edge of Pride Rock. Lightning strikes a nearby tree, causing a fire down below. Scar then brags to Simba over how he looks, not realizing he is openly admitting his own guilt for the lionesses to hear. He then whispers to Simba that he killed Mufasa, and Simba pounces on his murderous uncle. Scar confesses to his crime, but then sics the hyenas on the lionesses, beginning an all-out war. The lions battle the hyenas, while Timon, Pumbaa, and Rafiki all get a few good licks in.Simba then goes after Scar, who tries to run away. When Simba confronts him, Scar blames the hyenas and says that he was planning to kill them for their supposed crime. Scar begs Simba for mercy, and Simba orders him to do the same thing he ordered him to do as a cub: run away and never return.

Forensic analysis reveals they are the remains of a female Replicant (identified as such when K finds her ID number imprinted deep within her bones) who died 30 years ago during an emergency cesarean section, contradicting the belief that Replicants are sterile.

      "Title : Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, \n",
      " Synopsis : This stand-alone 'Fast and Furious' film opens in London, England where a team of MI6 agents led by Hattie Shaw (Vanessa Kirby) storm a warehouse to retrieve a deadly virus called \"The Snowflake\". They are found by the super-enhanced Brixton Lore (Idris Elba). Because of his cybernetic augmentations, he is able to sense incoming attacks, which allows him to wipe the floor with all of the other agents. Hattie injects her right hand with the Snowflake and escapes from Brixton's sight. He grabs a radio and makes it seem as though Hattie is a traitor who took the virus for herself.Meanwhile, Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) wake up in their own homes in Los Angeles and London. They go about their daily routines before later going to separate nightclubs to beat the crap out of dozens of goons before they each find one to interrogate. Both Hobbs and Shaw have heard about the super virus that has been going around, and they know it has been manufactured by a terrorist group called Eteon. Their respective goons fail to give them the info they want, so Hobbs tattoos \"I Love Cops\" on his forehead while Shaw leaves his guy dangling out a window.Hobbs has breakfast in a diner with his daughter Sam (Eliana Sua) when he is visited by an old friend/CIA agent Locke (Ryan Reynolds). He informs Hobbs about the Snowflake and just how serious of a threat it is. Although reluctant to help, Hobbs agrees to do so. At the same time, Shaw goes to visit his mother Magdalene, AKA \"Queenie\" (Helen Mirren), in prison. She tells him about Hattie's predicament and that he should reach out to her, but he doesn't think Hattie wants to see him. After leaving the prison, Shaw is approached by Agent Loeb (Rob Delaney) to also go after the Snowflake. This leads Hobbs and Shaw to come face-to-face once again with Locke and Loeb asking them to work together. Their response? \"No FUCKING way!\" After exchanging insults, the two begrudgingly agree to work together. The other agents track Hattie down for the guys to go after her.While Shaw goes to Hattie's booby-trapped home, Hobbs manages to find her on the streets. She fights Hobbs to get away, while Shaw is fought by agents trying to track Hattie. He beats them all across the room, while Hobbs manages to gain the upper hand and bring Hattie in.Hattie is taken back to the CIA headquarters for questioning by Hobbs. Shaw shows up and informs Hobbs that she is his sister. She tells them that she is carrying the virus, just before Brixton shows up and attacks. Shaw recognizes him as an old colleague that he supposedly killed years earlier. Brixton attempts to take Hattie with him by going down the building with a harness, but Hobbs and Shaw pursue. Hobbs slides down the harness to get rid of Brixton's goons before giving Hattie a chance to get away. Hobbs fights Brixton, only to discover he is no match for the superhuman. Shaw drives by to pick up Hobbs and Hattie, and Brixton chases after them on a motorcycle, but the heroes lose him after he crashes through a bus. The three then see that Eteon has manipulated the media into declaring them all fugitives and traitors. Hattie goes off to try and find Professor Andreiko (Eddie Marsan), the creator of the Snowflake and the one who can extract the virus from her. Hobbs shows that he was tracking Andreiko before the attack, and they manage to locate him at a newsstand.Brixton returns to Eteon's headquarters to get more juiced up. He speaks to Eteon's mysterious leader, who knows of both Hobbs and Shaw and wants Brixton to have them join Eteon.The trio talk to Andreiko, who says that he developed Snowflake for Eteon, but he left them after realizing their plan to use it on humanity and then force them to be fixed by Eteon. He tells them that the only way to get it out of Hattie is to kill her or extract it from her through a facility in the Ukraine. Shaw uses some of his own gear to help keep himself, Hattie, and Hobbs from being tracked or recognized. They head to Moscow using fake names, with Hobbs getting \"Mike Oxmaul\" and almost getting detained for it. While on the plane, Shaw tells Hobbs to back off of Hattie since he can tell that he is attracted to her. Hobbs taunts Shaw with the prospect of him hooking up with his sister, but their bickering wakes up the air marshal, Dinkley (Kevin Hart). He figures that the two are on a mission, and he bemoans his lack of action. Dinkley gives them his card for whenever they need something.In Moscow, the trio visit an old flame of Shaw's, Margarita, AKA Madame M (Eiza Gonzalez), who is the leader of an all-female crew of criminals that rob peoples homes. She provides them with weapons and gear that they need to storm the Eteon facility. Margarita then takes them to the facility where she makes it look like she is giving Hattie up to Brixton, who is already there after interrogating Andreiko. Hobbs and Shaw sneak their way around the place after dropping in from a jet. They encounter armed goons and proceed to pummel all of them in separate halls. They then use the unconscious goons to get inside, where they are greeted by dozens of armed Eteon agents. Both of them are captured and strapped to electrical cables for interrogation. Brixton tries to get them to join Eteon, with each additional shock coming closer to killing them. Hattie sneaks up on Brixton and almost kills him, but the gun she's holding requires an identity reader. Hobbs and Shaw get free, fight off more goons, and destroy the facility after retrieving the extraction device. Unfortunately, Brixton snaps Andreiko's neck and gets away again, and the device gets wrecked. Hobbs then figures out somewhere to lay low.The three travel to Samoa, Hobbs's childhood home where his estranged family lives. He returns to his mother Sefina (Lori Pelenisa Tuisano) and brothers Jonah (Cliff Curtis), Mateo (Roman Reigns), Timo (Josh Mauga), and Kal (John Tui), plus his three cousins. Jonah is especially dismayed to see Hobbs after his long absence. However, Sefina knows how urgent it is that the brothers help Hobbs out. They go to arm themselves as they prepare for Brixton and Eteon's goons to arrive, but Sefina has gotten rid of all their weapons. The plan then becomes that the family will fight Eteon with their bare hands and wits. Jonah fixes the device to start getting it out of Hattie.Brixton and Eteon are tracked as they make their way to the island. The Hobbs men stand ready for battle. The Eteon goons try to shoot them, but Hattie has disabled their guns. Fists begin to fly, bodies are thrown, and bones are broken as the agents are demolished by the Samoans. Brixton grabs Hattie and starts to escape on a helicopter. Hobbs and Shaw ride together while Jonah and the others follow. They hook their vehicles together like a train as Hobbs throws a hook onto the helicopter to bring it down. The helicopter crashes down below. Hobbs and Shaw face off against Brixton while Hattie has all of the Snowflake removed from her, and she kills Brixton's goon. Realizing he is just going to intercept their every move, Hobbs and Shaw resolve to fight him by having one of them take a hit while the other delivers a hit. This proves effective, as it causes Brixton's programming to overload. After witnessing his defeat, the Eteon leader deprograms Brixton's enhancements, and he dies before falling over the edge of the cliff. The unseen Eteon leader then speaks to Hobbs and Shaw, implying that they will see the two of them again.Afterwards, Shaw and Hattie go visit their mother in prison and leave her a cake that may contain something that will allow her to escape. Meanwhile, Hobbs decides to bring Sam to meet his family, as he has decided to stick around this time.During the credits, Locke contacts Hobbs again as he is fighting with other Eteon agents over another, possibly even more deadly virus. Locke also managed to stab a guy with a brick. In another scene, Hobbs gets Shaw back for the Moscow fake name by having the police get him and address him as \"Hugh Janus\". Shaw steps out but doesn't look like he's going to go quietly.\n",
