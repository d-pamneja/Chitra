The action is very unique, while also evoking memories of the Wachowskis' work on The Matrix. I really enjoyed the Vangelis-esque score used throughout. It helped create that dark, futuristic atmosphere necessary for the story. Even if you think you see where the story is going, it manages to go in unexpected directions. Between the cool concept, great sets, and dark themes, Upgrade is just that, an upgrade to the typical revenge action thriller.\\\", \\\"Through and through this movie felt like a longer episode of black mirror. The production was higher and the cinematography was really cool. I could see how the stabilization lock on his head during fight scenes could make some people dizzy, but I thought it was a unique way of doing things. Some of the acting was sub-par during the casual interactions, but I thought the plot and action made up for it. It's thought provoking in the way Black Mirror is and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys that content and doesn't mind gore.\\\", \\\"This has seriously become my favorite AI movie to date. I can't believe it was low budget because it's impossible to tell apart from the unknown actors who all do an excellent job. I will do my best to replace its lack of marketing with recommeding it to everyone. I was expecting something entertaining and instead got an amazing plot with a mind-blowing ending. If you enjoy this genre, you can't let this one pass you by. What everyone says is true, it's like a long, perfectly executed Black Mirror episode. I rated it 10 stars for the simple reason that I could not fine anything wrong with it or anything I didn't like. From beginning to end, this movie is amazing. I cannot recommend it enough.\\\", \\\"Brilliant.This movie is proof that you don't need all the special effects in the world to make an amazing sci fi movie. This is low budget done right (think Ex Machina).I signed up to IMDB to review this movie, I was that impressed. I see tons of people making that remark about films but honestly, this movie is unbelievable and for any sci fi fan out there, you need to watch this.I went in blind, no trailer, no knowledge of the movie what so ever and I would advise you do the same.The plot is simple, it's a revenge story that's been done countless times, yet it feels so fresh, acting Is slightly suspect throughout the first 10-15 minutes but the story will grip you, be patient.Honestly, I don't want to give anything away so just watch this movie.9.5/10Easily my favourite sci fi for a LONG time.Enjoy.\\\", \\\"Upgrade is unfortunately in the club of great movies that completely flew under the radar when first released. But that might actually work to its advantage, as this is definitely one of those movies where the less you know going in, the better. The only reason I was aware of Upgrade is because of writer/director Leigh Whannell (Saw, Insidious), and the fact I'd heard plenty of great things from friends who'd seen it. The film takes the all-too-familiar premise of a man looking to avenge the murder of his wife, and puts an interesting new sci-fi spin on it. Whannell clearly loves the classics, because Upgrade's influences are easy to spot - RoboCop, Blade Runner, Dredd, Death Wish. They've all been thrown in a blender, and what comes out is something that feels like its own movie, while also paying tribute to everything that inspired Whannell to become a filmmaker in the first place. Upgrade is violent, thought-provoking, funny, surprising, with some terrific fight sequences, an awesome soundtrack, and a dynamite performance from Logan Marshall-Green. I also get the feeling I'm gonna love it even more the next time I watch it. Highly recommended for fans of sci-fi/action.\\\", \\\"Probably worthy of a bigger production as it's a great science fiction story with comedy action and a few twists.One of those pleasant surprises that you don't expect in an unknown film, I've seen far worse more well known and promoted movies, worth a view.\\\", 'This film is basically \\\"Robocop\\\" meets \\\"Death Wish\\\", with less satire than the former and more humor than the latter. And it\\\\'s a B movie blast. An unrelenting pace, fantastic fight choreography that doesn\\\\'t skimp on the gleeful blood and gore, and never not fun or interesting to look at.Yeah some of the one-liner dialogue as delivered by Logan Marshall-Green feels a bit forced and the plot isn\\\\'t exactly clever or unique, but damn it, it all works and it makes it\\\\'s own beautiful alchemy out of a bunch of borrowed parts. This is cheap genre filmmaking done right.', \\\"I admit to enjoying UPGRADE, a simple science fiction-oriented twist on the usual revenge storyline. I'll say straight away that the plot is nothing special and has been done plenty of times before; it's the use of familiar but new technology that makes this interesting. The identity of the villains and the supporting characters are quite perfunctory, but the direction is inventive and the film particularly shines in the action scenes, so much so that you wish there were more of them. The main actor commits to his part quite neatly and there are enough decent set-pieces to make this an enjoyable watch, more so than plenty of bigger-budgeted fare.\\\", 'After watching this movie you will realize how bad every other major sci-fi has been in the past several years. This is a film with an excellent story, great cast, direction is on point, and the sci-fi is well developed. The gore is in your face ;) but it adds style to the movie and depth to the plot which one realizes later in the movie.A classic to remember. Look forward to seeing this again.', 'This movie has a plot that we have already seen in many movies, it\\\\'s a mix between \\\"Robocop\\\" and \\\"The Crow\\\", so let\\\\'s say that something was very predictable except for the ending that in my opinion was unexpected. One thing I really appreciated were the fight scenes that use a very particular camera movement that gave the right power and importance to the blows, scenes shot really well. I loved the performances of everyone, especially Benedict Hardie and Logan Marshall-Green. Highly recommended film, it may not be the most original thing in the world but it has its strengths.', '\\\"Upgrade\\\" (R, 1:35) is an action horror sci-fi comedy written and directed by Leigh Whannell, writer of the \\\"Insidious\\\" movies, the early \\\"Saw\\\" films, plus \\\"Dead Silence\\\", and director of \\\"Insidious: Chapter 3\\\". This movie was shot in Australia and Whannell and most of his cast are Australian. However, with the accents and the sets, you wouldn\\\\'t know the movie wasn\\\\'t American - and with the (lack of) quality in the last two \\\"Insidious\\\" movies, you wouldn\\\\'t guess that Whannell was behind this gem of a film.Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green, looking a lot like Tom Hardy) is an \\\"old school\\\" auto mechanic in a near future where intelligent, driverless cars are increasingly commonplace. He\\\\'s married to Asha (Melanie Vallejo), an employee at a high-tech company. They live in a house that\\\\'s suitably high-tech as well, operating with voice commands and equipped with a powerful computer embedded in a table top. They\\\\'re very happy... until one night when they\\\\'re on their way back from meeting one of Grey\\\\'s clients, a reclusive computer genius named Eron Keen (Harrison Gilbertson). Their car crashes and they get mugged. Asha is killed and Grey is paralyzed from the neck down, with only his mother to care for him.Eron visits Grey and offers him the opportunity to regain control of his body, with the help of a neck implant called Stem. The surgery succeeds spectacularly, Grey signs a non-disclosure agreement and heads home, promising that, at least for now, it appears to the world that he\\\\'s still a quadriplegic. Grey quickly learns that Stem can talk to him (as voiced by Simon Maiden). Given the lack of progress by a police investigator named Cortez (Betty Gabriel), Grey takes advantage of Stem\\\\'s Alexa-on-steroids capabilities to find the men who killed his wife. Normally not a violent man, Grey finds himself overmatched by these men, who themselves are technologically enhanced, until he learns how Stem can also help him fight. But, alas, avenging his wife\\\\'s death isn\\\\'t as satisfying as Grey might\\\\'ve expected.\\\"Upgrade\\\" is a very appropriate title, given some of the writer-director\\\\'s mediocre movies - and as a comparison to other films in the AI subgenre. This one is a combination of \\\"Deadpool\\\", \\\"Ex Machina\\\", \\\"Transcendence\\\" and the \\\"Bourne\\\" movies, but still feels fresh and creative, visually and narratively. The occasional comedy comes from the combination of Grey adjusting to having Stem\\\\'s cells in his brain and some gallows humor as he pursues his wife\\\\'s killers. The film also features one of the best recent casts you never heard of. The high-quality cinematography, editing, acting, pacing, directing and screenplay (with some late-game twists) makes this one of the most balanced and entertaining movies of 2018. \\\"A\\\"', \\\"I guess you can call this a B-movie, but that's not always a bad thing, and certainly not in this case.It has it's moments and some originality, which is rare in todays Hollywood remake factory.As for the B-movie thing it's worth mentioning the actor(s). The main actor had a little... uhm... stiff delivery.It doesn't hurt the movie in any way, it's a nice use of your time, and I will most likely watch it again.\\\", '\\\\'Upgrade\\\\' takes up many familiar dystopian sci-fi tropes and fuses them into a generic revenge-action movie. And if you came for the action there is a good change you will like this film. The fighting scenes, involving a combination of (slightly overpowered) superhero physics and grindhouse-like violence, certainly look spectacular, especially considering the low budget. However, if you, like me, came for thought-provoking sci-fi you will probably be disappointed. It\\\\'s not that it totally lacks great ideas, on the contrary. By touching on too many interesting topics (humanity\\\\'s increasing dependency on technology, governments and companies experimenting on humans, and, of course, the rise of Artificial Intelligence) you could even argue that the makers bit off more than they could chew. What remains is a cyberpunk action flick that never really goes into depth.The same can also be said of its main characters, all of which seem to lack any emotional complexity. Even the non-enhanced humans in the story often seem to act robotlike. This especially applies to Eron, but also to Grey, who, even though he is supposed to represent humanity in a world dominated by technology, is practically emotionless throughout the entire movie. The underlying problem here seems to be the pace of the film. With a first act taking up no more than ten minutes, the film takes absolutely no time to develop the main characters beyond the archetypes of the \\\"stubborn technophobe\\\", \\\"brilliant but anti-social inventor\\\", and the \\\"happy-go-lucky wife\\\". Not to mention the machine-hybrid cliche supervillain, who is especially hard to take seriously. The limited time you get to spend with these characters makes it even harder to genuinely feel for them as the story unfolds.The film, however, does succeed in bringing to life a dark, grim and empty world that feels painfully familiar and realistic - a sheer contrast with the characters that inhabit it. A scene, for example, that clearly stood out for me was the one with VR-junkies in the worn-out apartment building; it beautifully captured the blurred lines between the \\\"real\\\" and the \\\"fake\\\" that we increasingly seem to experience in everyday life. But even during these rare brilliant moments, the film felt rushed and overshadowed by action sequences. Admittedly, the ending was pretty surprising, but this could hardly compensate for structural flaws of the film. All in all, I found it an unfulfilling experience.', \\\"What an unexpectedly brilliant movie. Lots of laughs, some moments that I almost couldn't look, fabulously different story line, last minute surprise ending, car chases, and brilliant fight scenes.\\\", \\\"I think that many of the reviews below have already summed this movie up quite well. It's a standard revenge movie, but with a sci-fi twist and some incredibly impressive fight scenes. It's well-paced, well-acted, has a solid script, and the plot is more interesting and complicated than you might think from seeing the trailers alone.One other thing I really liked about it was the director's vision of the near future. With a few little exceptions (like how a computer chip in your neck can make you defy physics and stand up without bending any limb) the world here is very believable and depicted in such a way that was visually appealing without going too far as to make it look too flashy to be realistic.Don't let the fact that this was made by someone who directed one of the Insidious movies bother you either. This is wayyyyyy better than any of those movies. Director/writer Leigh Whannell has really found his footing here and delivered a movie that's highly entertaining and doesn't pull any punches.\\\", 'Upgrade is a straight-forward, entertaining violent action film about our potential near-future, and it\\\\'s not all that pretty. This movie is just like a Black Mirror episode, a modernistic yet pessimistic view of how technology is evolving. Some are for it, others are not. The anti-technology theme here is quite clear: Asimov may have been right.First, what did Upgrade do right? Well it\\\\'s certainly intense, with some really sweet fight scenes and unique choreography. The camera work was fun too. It\\\\'s an engaging story, good acting, overall a fantastic movie if you love sci-fi and violence.However, there were some issues. For one, the fight scenes were disappointingly few and far in between. I may have been misled by other reviews, but do not go in expecting something like \\\"The Raid\\\" movies. Some plot holes were spotted, and on a personal level, I do not go looking for those while enjoying a movie. Additionally, the plot holes were as obvious as the plot was predictable. So don\\\\'t expect any ground-breaking story here.But its intentions weren\\\\'t to grab an Oscar in Best Original Script, or any Oscar for that matter. Its intents were evidently to entertain those who just wanted a great sci-fi action thriller without having to think too much, and to warn us of possible dangers lurking behind the excitement of the modern evolution of technology. So, I guess enjoy the movie, but be cautious of that thing on your kitchen counter that tells you the weather and controls the lights.', \\\"As stories go, Upgrade isn't anything particularly spectacular. There's some really good ideas of course, but the idea of cyborgs and AI taking over humanity are as old as technology itself. It also surprisingly draws parallels to a superhero movie released in the same year; Venom, where a normal Tom Hardy-looking guy finds himself possessed by an entity that helps him get what he wants by controlling his body. Where Upgrade really shines is in its execution. The build-up leading to multiple multi-layered twists upon each other lend the film an unpredictable narrative complexity, where multiple rewatches are guaranteed to illuminate more subtle complexities, callbacks, and foreshadowing.Something that really makes Upgrade stand out is Logan Marshall-Green, who offers a truly impressive physical performance that is both demanding and complicated to achieve. The controlling of his body by an AI leads to some stylish fight choreography, and Marshall-Green doesn't stutter in adding robotic, calculated movements to those scenes, while simultaneously acting in juxtaposition with his head and facial expressions. He's confused and bewildered while he slices a guy up with a kitchen knife, he brags and gloats while his body effortlessly dispatches of goons, he pleads with bad guys not to continue fighting while his robotic-moving arms quickly and decisively disarm and dispatch of them. He holds such an impressive disconnect between his head and his body that I couldn't even imagine how hard it must have been to develop such physical coordination while acting and making it look effortless at the same time. Marshall-Green has never particularly impressed me before, but he has now.Even further though are clever uses of cameras adding another dimension to the film's visual identity. The high points are, again, the fight scenes, where the camera is just as involved in the choreography as the actors and stuntmen are. To add an even greater emphasis on the disconnect between Grey's mind and his body, the camera often keeps him fixed in frame while the settings around him movie. He's just enjoying the ride while his body does the moving, and we're put in that mindset. The way they did it is mount the camera in a rotating frame, hide a phone on Marshall-Green's body, and get them to match orientation. When Marshall-Green moves, the camera moves with him. This becomes especially impressive when Grey ducks and dives, or does full-on back-flips, and the camera mirrors his movements perfectly.Beyond that, the cinematography goes a long way to make this low-budget movie look much more expensive. Lighting is dim and harsh, camera angles are conservative yet stylish, and the CGI is used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary, which has a knock-on effect of grounding an otherwise futuristic world without getting too lofty. The score by Jed Palmer is also fantastic. I was maybe a little disappointed that Whannell didn't go for a Saw-esque climatic track for the third-act revelations, but nonetheless the score is evocative of sci-fi movies of the 70s and 80s, with borderline synthwave tracks interspersed amongst more ambient sounds.Upgrade is a solid sci-fi flick that manages to be refreshing and unique despite its otherwise overdone story elements. It ended up being a better Venom movie than Venom. All it took was an imaginative filmmaker like Leigh Whannell. I honestly can't wait to see what he manages to do next. I give Upgrade a solid 8/10.\\\", \\\"'Upgrade' is a hybrid action/comedy/horror flick written and directed by Leigh Whannell, who previously brought us the highly successful 'Saw' and 'Insidious' franchises.It stars Logan Marshall-Green, who shall forever be known as Tom Hardy's doppelganger (seriously--compare photos), opposite Betty Gabriel, a rising star famous for her turn in the breakout hit 'Get Out.'While the acting and overall concept are both quite remarkable, there's an unmistakable clunkiness to the film, alternating between the dialogue, blocking, and editing.However, the cinematography is superb, especially on such a low budget, and the action sequences when the bio-mechanical aspect of the film are fully utilized simply aren't to be missed.\\\", 'I went into this with fairly low expectations. The trailer looked good, and the cinematography looked exciting. But the premise seemed tired and worn.*in a deep, movie-voice over voice* some guys kill his wife, and now he\\\\'s seeking revenge\\\".But this film surpassed my expectations, and was a well-worth experience. Not only was I correct about the cinematography being exciting and engaging, but the plot actually strung together compelling way. This film came out of nowhere for me, and now, it\\\\'s a memorable film that accomplishes the most important goal of any great film: gets the audience to keep wondering about it.Since I don\\\\'t want to go into spoilers, I\\\\'ll say one last thing: pay attention to the Foley artist\\\\'s work. The sound design is poignant and additive to the experience. It reminds me of the clever usage of music from Baby Driver. Nothing is wasted and is always enriching of the world building. With Baby Driver, the music was giving us Baby\\\\'s personal experience. Here, the sound effects give us Grey\\\\'s point of view. Didn\\\\'t experiences, but both are elevated through sound, masterfully.I genuinely want to see it again. If the trailer interested you at all, go see it. It\\\\'s worth your while.', \\\"Not a lot of buzz was made about this film which kind of landed in theaters with no hype. I saw one trailer at some point and knew I wanted to check it out. Logan Marshall-Green isn't exactly someone who is a leading man. Ryan Atwood's brother and a role in Prometheus are his most notable roles. So it was nice to see him as a lead, and a lesser known cast in this film. Overall, I felt the plot can be tweaked at some points but its a fun film.The film is about a man named Grey, who becomes paraplegic after he and his wife were attacked by a group of hitmen. He is approached by a tech innovator who puts a device in his body which allows him to walk and control his limbs again.. in a way. The device is actually a smart system called STEM and sometimes STEM is allowed to take over, especially when Grey is in danger. Grey uses this newfound ability to track down the men who killed his wife.Insidious: Chapter 3 wasn't overly memorable for me so I feel like this film is where Leigh Whannell puts a stamp on his film making style. The action scenes are excellent when they come. The chase and combat on screen are stellar. The film does well to use its futuristic setting to set a landscape for the film, which itself still feels modern. The film also has humor at the right times. Its not overbearing but when it comes it feels right.My main concerns with the film was the underdeveloped side characters and there's a bit of convenience when need be. The plot feels like it could have been worked in a less cloudy manner but its not a major detraction from the rest of the effort. Its a surprisingly different effort. We've seen this type of film before but the film still seems to remain fresh and fun. Not really a title people are going to talk about this year but its good fun and that's good enough.7/10\\\", 'Really enjoyed this movie. A very good dose of future technology and where it would lead us to. We are already seeing the birth of some of the concepts shown in this movie and like with any technology there will be good usage and bad.\\\\nI dont understand the bad comments on violence as it is \\\"indirect\\\" (without giving away).\\\\nFast paced and suspenseful. Logan Marshall-Green acted well without any \\\"overacting\\\" or showing off. Screen play and direction were very good. It is original concept and I did not see any connection with Death wish or other movies - not even close or people did not understand the movie?', 'Upgrade greatly exceeded my expectations: truly entertaining, and remarkably well produced. Great acting by the lead character. Stylistically speaking, it\\\\'s perfect: very good cinematography, amazing fight choreography, beautiful scenography and music, perfect CGI, and the overall \\\"feel\\\" of the atmosphere. Only 5 millions were spent. Often, you will not find that attention for scenography and CGI in Hollywood productions.\\\\nIn the end, it\\\\'s a little nice movie with a standard plot that nonetheless got me hooked: it got more and more entertaining, and then some more. There are many cliches, but that\\\\'s a plus: when the director is good, having a cliche smoothly inserted into the story is pure fun. Each of the main events has a reason to be and a nice explanation (sometimes, it\\\\'s quite original), so that the story never really feels that \\\"standard\\\".\\\\nThere are just a couple of minor holes here and there, but nothing like what you will read in some reviews: infact, the structure is perfectly logic, and if part of the audience doesn\\\\'t pay attention, that\\\\'s not movie\\\\'s fault.Ps: forgot to mention... I realized I never saw a movie depicting cyber-bio-implants or whatever. Blade Runner does not, Ex-Machina does not, Strange days does not. This movie finally does.', 'If you wanted to see \\\"Venom\\\" but didn\\\\'t want to be distracted by all of the high end special effects and quality acting from Tom Hardy then \\\"Upgrade\\\" is the movie for you\\\\nLogan Marshall Green puts in a brilliant \\\"I\\\\'m not Tom Hardy\\\" performance. His inner dialogue with Kit from \\\"Knight Rider\\\" is beyond reproach.\\\\nTwo thumbs!', \\\"After ten minutes I came close to switching it off, as I couldn't get into it, it felt as though they were spending too much time showing off future technology, however I stuck with it, and was glad I did, as it develops it really does open up, it became a wonderfully gripping and entertaining sci fi thriller. Very well acted throughout, a pretty original story, and lots of action scenes.The accident really does change the movie up, and the tone, it really is well worth a look, the ending may come as a surprise for some.Very good, 8/10.\\\"]\",\n          \"[\\\"I love Shakespeare, but I've also always had a soft spot for Ophelia. This reimagining of Hamlet is not faithful to the original text, so have an open mind and you may enjoy it. I don't generally like movies that apply modern sensibilities to classic stories and characters, but this one was tolerable. The acting was fine, the sets and costumes beautiful. Overall it was a fine film. But if you're a purist, don't bother.\\\", \\\"I don't understand why the reviews for this one are so bad. I found this movie quite enjoyable. The acting seemed fine to me and the scenery and costume designs were really lovely. I enjoyed watching this movie a lot. I suppose those looking for the traditional portrayal of Hamlet might be disappointed. I enjoyed the updated dialogue and storyline from Ophelia's point of view. Give it a chance - you'll likely be pleased you did.\\\", \\\"Hard to believe the hostility directed against this movie.\\\\nIt's not Hamlet, but another take on the story from the viewpoint of Ophelia. The director chose to show the protagonist as a strong women.\\\\nEnjoyed the character development and the storyline. Directing was solid. All the actors were quite believable in their roles.\\\", \\\"I watched this because I wanted to see what Daisy Ridley's acting was like outside of Star Wars. I had seen her in Murder on the Orient Express, but her role was relatively small in that. This film isn't incredibly exciting, but Ridley certainly gives a fine performance as a fleshed-out Ophelia. The other actors carry themselves well, in addition; and the period sets, costumes, and locations are convincing.\\\", \\\"This was enjoyable in my opinion. I've seen Hamlet. I've read the play. This is not an exact remake of the original work but I liked that it was a reimagining.In this film, Ophelia is our main character and we seen how things unfold from her perspective. Her role in the original work is a big deal seeing as she was the innocence in a corrupt court who was driven to insanity and then suicide after the deaths of the men she loved most. Suicide was her escape from all the revenge, evil and madness taking place around her. Here we see her much more resilient without losing her innocent nature. The basic plot of the film is still present but things don't go down the same way.I thought it was filmed well and the acting was good. I thought the concept presented was creative. I'm sure that a lot of folks will take issue and feel like it was to far removed from the original work but if you take it for what it is rather than point out all the differences, it was a good film. I say check it out.\\\", \\\"It is not surprising the name of the costume designer features so early in the credits because he played a major role in making this film so watchable. All those gorgeous costumes must have cost a bit but along with some splendid d\\u00e9cor, ecclesiastical and baronial interiors (and a few exteriors) and outdoor scenes of woods glades and hills this film never fail to offer pleasure for the eye. The story proceeds at a sufficient pace with some unexpected twists and turns while bringing out how empty and unsatisfying royal or any great power can be. Is it really worth fighting so hard for? Pity about the mayhem of the penultimate scene, it was unnecessary, but makes Ophelia's choice at the end seem a wise one.\\\", 'Critics seem to have difficulties agreeing on whether this is a spin-of of Hamlet to tell Ophelia\\\\'s story, or simply Hamlet\\\\'s story told from Ophelia\\\\'s POV. I tend to side with the former.\\\\nOne thing definitely reimagined here is that Ophelia is no longer a helpless, passive victim eventually driven to madness. She is all courage, intelligence, wit, spirit, resourceful, and more. And why not, if she is played by Daisy Ridley whom we know best as Rey, the new heroine in the third and final trilogy of the Star Wars saga that spanned the silver screen for over 4 decades. Incidentally, in about 2 months, our patience will be rewarded with the answer to Rey\\\\'s real heritage. But I digress.\\\\nAmong other things, this movie has a generous offer of witty word plays. Right at the start, when Ophelia as a child (Mia Quiney) is taken under the wings of Queen Gertrude (Naomi Watts), the first exchange includes the Queen\\\\'s mild exclamation of \\\"Alas, indeed\\\", which is turned by the witty Ophelia into \\\"a lass\\\", as she is often mistaken for a boy in her tomboyish childhood.\\\\nIn the first encounter (not counting stealing glances at each other at a distance) between Ophelia and Hamlet (George MacKay), she is fully submerged in serene lake water when surprised by him and Horatio on shore. Hamlet promptly commented that as she is a lady-in-waiting, perhaps she wouldn\\\\'t mind waiting a bit longer. They would not inconvenience themselves on her account with looking for another spot for fishing. Totally unruffled, Ophelia teasingly emerges from water in tantalizingly slow motion, only to have the jaw-dropping Hamlet finally discover that she is fully clothed (Horatio has already walked away in embarrassment). That is a most definitive establishing scene of Ophelia.\\\\nOther depiction of Ophelia includes \\\"she dances like a goat\\\" (as per the other ladies-in-waiting). B then, she is \\\"a girl that can read\\\", surprising Gertrude who immediately gets even as Ophelia finds that her bedside reading to the queen is not a book of religious devotion but passionate novels of romance.\\\\nIn this movie, the Shakespearean English has been modernized, exemplified in probably the best-known fatherly advice, \\\"Neither a borrower nor a lender be\\\". Here, what Polonius says to Laertes becomes \\\"Do not borrow any money or lend it\\\". Incidentally if you find the face of the actor who plays Ophelia\\\\'s brother Laertes familiar, you should. This is none other than Tom Felton, otherwise better known as Draco Malfoy in Harry-Potter-verse. But I digress again.\\\\nFor the top-tier star presence, in addition to Ridley and Watts, there is also Clive Owen who plays the usurping uncle Claudius, most likely with more malice than you have seen anywhere else before. Note also that Watts plays not just one character, but two! Entirely new to the plot is Mechtild, a mysterious witch from whom Gertrude obtains potions for preservation of youthful looks. She also carries a secret that affects the big picture but let me not spoil it. Similarly, I will not spoil the plot which initially follows the Bard\\\\'s but later throws in some twists.\\\\nAs mentioned in my \\\"headline\\\", this movie has aa art-house feel, but is not get overboard. The pace, for one thing, is brisk. The cinematography is first-rate, as well as costume design. There is much to enjoy, if this is your cup of tea.', \\\"I didn't know what to expect but I thought it was a pretty cool movie. I don't know much about Hamlet but I was entertained. Bravo.\\\", \\\"I read the book by Lisa Klein that this is based on as a teenager. I loved it, so I might be a bit biased, but I didn't mind the changes to the Hamlet story. I thought the costumes, sets, and everything where gorgeous. The casting is good and most of the actors do the best they can with weakly written dialogue. My other TINY complaint is that they changed the ending from the book where she ends up with Horatio.Also, ignore the people who complain about having actors of different races in a medieval story. It's the 21st century. I think it's okay to cast the actor who is best for the role without getting hung up on race.\\\", '\\\"Ophelia\\\" is a Drama - Romance movie in which we watch Hamlet from Ophelia\\\\'s perspective. She was raised by Queen Gertrude in Elsinore Castle and she had some feelings for Prince Hamlet. Passion, romance, vengeance combined in this movie.I found this movie interesting and different since it\\\\'s from a different perspective than usual. The direction which was made by Claire McCarthy was good and she presented well her main characters and the plot behind her movie. The interpretation of Daisy Ridley who played as Ophelia was good and her combination with some other actors/actresses created a good result. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Naomi Watts\\\\'s who played as Gertrude / Mechtild, Clive Owen\\\\'s who played as Claudius and George MacKay\\\\'s who played as Hamlet. Finally, I have to say that \\\"Ophelia\\\" is an interesting movie and I recommend you to watch it just from curiosity.', 'Never mind all the fake early ten-star reviews here--if you can\\\\'t tell they\\\\'re fake from the writing, click on the person\\\\'s handle and you\\\\'ll see that inevitably they have never posted about another movie before.This movie gets five stars for being well-produced, good-looking, professionally acted and crafted. I can\\\\'t argue that it would probably entertain less discriminating (and younger) audiences, esp. if they have no prior experience with \\\"Hamlet.\\\" (God help the high school student who one day is going to figure they can skip reading the play and do a book report just from seeing this film.) But if you ARE at all familiar with \\\"Hamlet,\\\" this is is pretty ludicrous. It\\\\'s not that it departs from the play in many ways; \\\"Hamlet\\\" is such a ubiquitous classic that it can certainly withstand and even welcome some imaginative, revisionist takes.(partial spoilers ahead] The probolem is that this particular take is that of a stereotypical current teenage romance-novel-slash-fantasy a la \\\"Twilight\\\" and \\\"Wicked.\\\" Poor Ophelia must of course be a spunky little rebel who only PRETENDS to go mad, won\\\\'t let men tell her what to do, and other things that seem more than a bit preposterous for a young lady in a medieval Danish court. Of course Hamlet is ALL about her, in a brooding, lovesick, tormented Robert Pattinson-in-\\\"Twilight\\\" way. Things are manipulated so crazily to make O. the center of this whole story that she even sees the Ghost of Hamlet\\\\'s father before he does! Because she is just that special.Gertrude is made to be bitchy and insecure, reducing Naomi Watts\\\\' performance; Clive Owen is solid as Claudius, and other performances are OK. But it\\\\'s distracting that another concession to young audiences is making the court multi-ethnic, as if there were many black people around in 11th-century Denmark or whenever this is supposed to be. It\\\\'s not that this is quasi-modernized, which needn\\\\'t be a bad thing; it\\\\'s that it\\\\'s done in such a stereotypical, shallow, trendy fashion that the effect is ultimately kinda laughable.You can\\\\'t say this is really a \\\"feminist\\\" take, because it\\\\'s too juvenile in its approach--Ophelia may be somewhat \\\"empowered,\\\" but she\\\\'s also the girl whom the Prince himself offers to \\\"walk away from it all\\\" for! She\\\\'s supposed to be \\\"tough,\\\" in a sort of Katniss-in-\\\"Hunger Games\\\" way, but she also gets to be Cinderella, too. If you\\\\'re getting the feeling from my description that this movie piles up way too many cliches in order to hit the target audience bull\\\\'s-eye, you\\\\'d be exactly right. But jiudging from the film\\\\'s reception so far, obviously you can OVERESTIMATE what your audience presumably wants, and give them so much of it that they feel condescended to. This expensive-looking movie is pretty much going straight to VOD, and that is because it is more 21st-century \\\"Gidget\\\" than \\\"Hamlet.\\\" Doing the story from Ophelia\\\\'s point of view was a good idea--and someday, someone may do it right.', 'As a huge fan of Shakespeare, I truly enjoyed this alternate take on the tale of Hamlet and Ophelia. The star-studded cast was a delight to watch deliver superb performances. The sets were absolutely breathtaking and the costuming was tasteful and evocative. The film was a rich feast of color and the music touched my heart. I found myself singing along with the theme and humming it after the end of the movie. I just love that a woman wrote the book, another the screenplay and the director was female as well. This definitely is a step in the right direction of telling \\\"herstory\\\" to take its rightful place aside \\\"history\\\".', \\\"People are very harsh.

I quite like it, the movie has an interesting story and is acted and filmed very well.I have the advantage of not knowing very much at all about Shakespeare\\\\'s \\\"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\\\" , the source play for the book and now the movie. As the filmmakers explain, this is a re-imagining of the basic story with more focus on Ophelia and Queen Gertrude, and what the complexity of their characters might have been. Die-hard Shakespeare fans most likely take issue, anything that changes from his various versions would likely be considered unforgivable sins.But taken as a story greatly \\\"inspired\\\" by the play, with some significant changes and trajectory for Ophelia, it works very well, at least it does for me. Not a great movie but certainly very watchable and suitably entertaining. Not a \\\"10\\\", not a \\\"1\\\", somewhere between those extremes.Daisy Ridley is really good as Ophelia, playing her as a reasonable but strong person. I don\\\\'t really know much of his work but George MacKay (mac-eye) works well as Hamlet and Naomi Watts as Gertrude.', 'There are so many expeditions into the forest and a cave that are made by Ophelia in this film that it is easy to confuse \\\"Ophelia\\\" with \\\"Dora and the Lost City of Gold\\\"!Tom Stoppard\\\\'s \\\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\\\" was a play and later a film that showed Shakespeare\\\\'s \\\"Hamlet\\\" from the perspectives of two schlubs who are given their fifteen minutes of fame. By contrast, \\\"Ophelia\\\" deconstructs Shakespeare\\\\'s narrative not only to unfold the action from Ophelia\\\\'s point of view, but it also completely reinvents the character and the narrative.In the bonus track of the DVD of \\\"Ophelia,\\\" one of the film\\\\'s producers described their Ophelia as a \\\"spitfire,\\\" and within the film itself, she describes herself to us as \\\"willful.\\\" The director, Claire McCarthy, noted a \\\"tongue-in-cheek\\\" stylistic approach to the Shakespearean classic in the way that characters and events are entirely changed.Some of the most outrageous choices were have Ophelia marry Hamlet! The ceremony takes place in the forest in the style of Friar Lawrence overseeing the ceremony of Romeo and Juliet tying the knot. The quick-thinking Ophelia is also making rounds on the ramparts of Elsinore late at night on the lookout for the Ghost. Ophelia and Hamlet are both aware of that eavesdropping is occurring in a crucial scene, so they begin to whisper to each other as Claudius and Polonius are listening in. This Ophelia also does not go mad, but rather feigns the madness, giving an award-winning performance of the staged mad songs in front of the court. But the most radical change is that Ophelia stages her own death, giving the impression that she has drowned in the river!The filmmakers clearly wanted to avoid any semblance of Ophelia as a victim. In the bonus track of the DVD, McCarthy reiterated how this Ophelia was to have \\\"agency\\\" in her life. She begins as a commoner, then rises to the level of handmaiden to Queen Gertrude, prior to marrying the Prince of Denmark, and ultimately living to become a widow and proud single mom!The film was directed by a woman, and the screenplay was written by a woman, based on a woman\\\\'s novel. The featured characters, Ophelia and Gertrude, were woman, and a new female character of the \\\"healer\\\" named Mechtild, is Gertrude\\\\'s sister, who is always available to provide poisons, potions, and cure-alls in her cave.To crown it off, there is the convent of St. Emilion, where women who are harassed at the court may flee to safety. The protagonist will in time avail herself of the sanctuary afforded by St. Emilion. So, when Hamlet tells Ophelia, \\\"Get thee to a nunnery,\\\" he is providing the most important advice that will help to ensure victory for our Super Heroine, turning her into an Ophelia for our time!!', \\\"Based on the novel by Lisa Klein, the film follows the story of Hamlet from Ophelia's perspective. The movie boasts of a talented cast, tells the story on a different and interesting point of view and has a great ending. Unfortunately it suffers from some script's problems and sometimes it isn't as gripping as it should have been.Rating: 6,5.\\\", \\\"As a rebellious and motherless child , orphan Ophelia (Mia Quiney) is taken into Elsinore Castle by Queen Gertrude (Naomi Watts) as one of her most trusted ladies-in-waiting and at the luxury palace she meets a young Hamlet (Jack Cunningham) .

Entertaining, engaging enough to hold my interest, with an interesting plot.\\\", \\\"I really don't understand why there are so many really negative reviews and positive reviews being downvoted. Is it Daisy? Is it that someone's approached Shakespeare from a new angle?I'll never find out the answer but it's a real shame.I really loved this movie. I wasn't sure on Daisy in this kind of role having only seen her in Star Wars before but I actually think she played it beautifully. I have seen someone else say they think this would have been a Kiera Knightley role ten years ago and I agree, but she would have ruined it. It needed to be understated. It needed to be timid as well as strong. None of that makes sense I suppose but in my head it does.I'm not a fan of Naomi Watts or Clive Owen but they were watchable and actually I cried for Naomi's Gertrude at the end.The costumes are gorgeous, the scenery and settings beautiful and the soundtrack is wonderful, especially the music playing over the ending scenes.It made me interested in Hamlet again.\\\", \\\"As a person who never read Shakespeares' work and is not familiar with this story, I think this movie was just okay.Pros - the production design and cinematography is kinda cool. There are some really cool shots throughout the movie & dresses, the location, they felt real.Daisy Ridley was pretty good as Ophelia, it was kinda nice to see her in something other than Star Wars.The film is overall not that bad and watchable at times, but a lot of the time I couldn't help but think it was just mid.The characters in this movie are very flat. Even though some actors tries their best and you can kinda see it, but the script doesn't explore or develop these characters that much. They didn't feel interesting other than Ophelia.

Great story with really good acting from the leads. Great cast overall. So far I have loved every role I have seen Chadwick Boseman play, he is a great actor and has this sort of swagger when acting. Sterling K Brown is great and one of the greatest actors in recent years. It was different but enjoyable seeing Josh Gad in a drama. I wish they would make more of these movies that follow Thurgood Marshall's journey. The only negative thing is that it felt a bit long.\\\", 'Greetings again from the darkness. The question must be asked: is the movie worthy of the man? The man was the first attorney for the NAACP. He won 29 of the 32 cases he argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, including the ground-breaking 1954 Brown v. Board of Education (separate but equal public education). This man was a trailblazer for Civil Rights, and in 1967 became the first African- American Supreme Court Justice. This man was, of course, Thurgood Marshall \\\\x85 a man who unquestionably deserves not just a movie, but a really good and important one.Chadwick Boseman has taken on film versions of such icons as Jackie Robinson in 42 and James Brown in GET ON UP, so he likely jumped at the chance to play the revered figure, Thurgood Marshall. Mr. Boseman has true movie star screen presence, and supplies the young Mr. Marshall with a self-assured swagger that accompanies a brilliant legal mind \\u2013 a mind that refused to be ignored during a time it was desperately needed. Lest he be labeled a superhero, the film does portray Marshall smoking and drinking, while also hinting at his carousing. The common flaws of a great man.It\\\\'s 1941 and the young (33 years old) Marshall is the lone NAACP attorney, so he spends his time ping-ponging around the country fighting for fair trials for those African-Americans accused simply because they aren\\\\'t white. He works only for \\\"innocent\\\" people and his efforts during this time were crucial to the Civil Rights movement gaining attention and legitimacy. Most of the film centers on a case in Connecticut (no, not the Jim Crow south) where a black man, Joseph Spell (Sterling K Brown), is accused of sexual assault of a \\\"respectable\\\" married white woman, Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson). If you are reminded of the great book and film TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, you must know that those literary and cinematic standards are such that few can ever hope to reach.What follows is not one of the more dramatic or tension-filled cinematic courtroom dramas. There is simply too much levity for the film to be classified as a historical heavyweight. That said, the man and his story are fascinating, and though director Reginald Hudlin chooses a deft touch rather than a sledge hammer, it\\\\'s likely the wise choice if the goal is to entertain, while also educating the masses to Marshall\\\\'s early career. Josh Gad co-stars as Marshall\\\\'s co-counsel Sam Friedman, a specialist in legal technicalities within the insurance industry. Boseman and Gad have nice chemistry (at times it feels like a buddy movie), and as a Jew in those times, Friedman is himself stuck in limbo between staunch racism and acceptance by the white community.James Cromwell plays Judge Foster, yet another man caught between the old world he has lived in his entire life and the fast-changing society and legal system that permits him to silence Marshall, while also forcing (somewhat) fair treatment of the accused Spell. Dan Stevens (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST) is Loren Willis, the disgusted and disgusting prosecutor. This character is so cartoonish that the only thing missing is a neon necklace that flashes \\\"racist\\\" as he speaks. Sophia Bush has a brief, yet important scene and Sterling K Brown (as Mr. Spell) has the film\\\\'s most heart-breaking moment as he sits on the stand and explains why he lied.Director Reginald Hudlin seems like an odd choice for the project. He has been working mostly in TV since back-to-back-to-back bombs BOOMERANG (Eddie Murphy), THE LADIES MAN (Tim Meadow) and SERVING SARA (Matthew Perry). Mr. Hudlin has experienced more success as a Producer, having been Oscar nominated for DJANGO UNCHAINED. Here he works with the father and son screenwriters Jacob Koskoff and Michael Koskoff. The elder Michael is a well respected criminal attorney and legal historian, and certainly understands the expectations that come with offering a public look at a near- mythical figure \\\\x85 especially one as revered as Thurgood Marshall.This isn\\\\'t so much a movie about the icon as it is about a young man on the path to greatness and importance (he served on the Supreme Court from 1967-1991). The soundtrack is filled with jazz which complements the light-hearted approach, and further distances from any semblance of \\\"heavy\\\" or \\\"historical\\\". Director Hudlin adds a contemporary touch by having Trayvon Martin\\\\'s parents (Sybrina Fulton, Tracy Martin) appear in a scene near the end. On the downside, multiple upshot camera angles are designed to make his lead character look larger than life. The truth is, Thurgood Marshall required no help in looming large. Hopefully this mainstream approach pays off and many are introduced to the legacy of a man who is more than worthy of this movie \\\\x85 and another.', 'I got to attend an early screening of Marshall tonight. I\\\\'m interested to see how critics react. I have a feeling many of them will object to the \\\"paint-by-numbers\\\" approach to the film. While we have not seen Thurgood Marshall represented much in film, it does feel like we\\\\'ve seen this movie more than once before. But that isn\\\\'t really the point. I\\\\'ve eaten spaghetti and meatballs hundreds of times before. I still enjoy it each time, the same dish, so long as it is made well. And Marshall, while not reinventing any wheels, is made well. Chadwick Boseman leads a terrific cast that includes Josh Gad, Dan Stevens, James Cromwell, Kate Hudson and Sterling K. Brown. Everyone is there to give this very important true story some depth and weight. At the same time, the screenplay never gets too caught up in its own self-importance. While some very dark themes and tragic events are present, there is a sense of humor pervading much of the film. This makes the people and events portrayed in Marshall relatable, instead of feeling like we\\\\'re watching a group of untouchable, stoic historical figures. Marshall isn\\\\'t designed to inspire anger or guilt, instead it encourages us to examine examples of unity that have been used to overcome struggle. It has more in common with films like The Help or Hidden Figures, than more aggressive films like Detroit (though that film is very intense and impressive). I would say Marshall will play out just as well at home as it does in a theater, but there is something about seeing it with a crowd that in this case adds to the experience. The gasps of the audience when an atrocity is displayed, the clapping when a bigot loses his/her battle-it is a good film to enjoy with an audience. From a technical standpoint, the film does not go out of its way to impress. The cinematography, costume and production design, music, editing-all seems serviceable if not particularly memorable. In this case its the story and the figures it portrays that you\\\\'ll remember. 7/10.', 'Growing up one of the first influential black figures I learned about was Supreme Court Judge Thurgood Marshall. While my life didn\\\\'t veer in the path he took, it was a chance for me as a young black male to see the dedication and time he took to his craft and where it could take you. Almost 2 decades have passed since then, and found myself surprised to see a film finally based on him and his capabilities. While the younger me was excited, I found myself wondering how this film would hold up side by side with other black period films like itself in recent history.Thurgood (Chadwick Boseman) is working in the NAACP when he is tapped for a court case of the accusation of a black male rumored to have raped a woman and thrown her off into the river and left for dead. While he travels to Connecticut for the trial, he finds himself hard pressed given he is a out of town lawyer unfamiliar to the client, and is left to have a inexperienced attorney (Josh Gad) to speak on his behalf in court. While Thurgood knows most of the material and how to move in court, he has to show Josh\\\\'s character the way to observe things his way.The performances are all relatively solid by no surprise given the cast. Josh Gad is able to sell the inexperienced character almost having to be hand held through every decision made in the courtroom. Also the development of him progressively becoming more confident as time goes forward. The writing in the courtroom is interesting enough to keep you invested in knowing what\\\\'s the truth and the holes in one plaintiff and defendants stories.Alas, my biggest issue with the film is really the lasting impact. While it is perfectly watchable in the moment, I felt as if a story like this should have had more lasting impact than what I saw given it\\\\'s a film in a movie theater. It\\\\'s not as riddled with clich\\u00e9s like preceding films I\\\\'ve seen in the past, but misses a strong distinctive voice. For some the issues I had with Hidden Figures, I at least know who the target audience was for the film and what they wanted to take from the movie. Marshall doesn\\\\'t really have that same feeling. The writing is never bad, but never as sharp as it feels like it should be until the second half when more gets revealed.Marshall in a nutshell I would say is \\\"almost there\\\" as a movie. Fine within the moment but leaves a bit desired when the credits rolled. I wouldn\\\\'t turn anyone away from seeing this, but may be best suited seen at home.', 'This enjoyable and inspiring movie is a worthy contribution to the courtroom movie genre. It memorializes the great Thurgood Marshall (who later won Brown v. Bd. of Education and sat on the Supreme Court). The film brings to life a forgotten rape case in Connecticut that Marshall tried early in his career when he was the solo staff lawyer at the NAACP. The story focuses on the plight of a black man accused of raping a white woman and it highlights issues of racism in the courtroom and on the streets. The movie recalls the classic fllms \\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\\" (which also involved a black on white rape case) and \\\"Anatomy of a Murder\\\" (which also involved sexual issues and in which--like many real trials--we\\\\'re never sure just what actually happened and who is telling the truth). The writing is sharp and witty and the acting and direction are great. Particularly strong is the emerging partnership and friendship of Marshall and the local lawyer, Sam Friedman, who had never tried a criminal case and thought he would just sit next to Marshall during the trial and and do nothing. But the judge forces Friedman to conduct the trial with Marshall serving as his adviser--and he rises to the occasion.', 'Whether it\\\\'s the Godfather of Soul, the first black baseball player, or the first black superhero, it\\\\'s fair to say Chadwick Boseman is becoming one of the best actors of his generation.So there was high hopes for this bio-pic about NAACP Civil Rights lawyer and first black supreme court justice Thurgood Marshall.The film looks at one of the first cases of his career; a black chauffeur accused of rape by his white employer in Connecticut. Josh Gad is also in the film as a Jewish lawyer roped into being lead on the case when a judge decrees Marshall can only assist. This is important as the Gadd character has never tried a criminal case before.You keep expecting Boseman to get that nomination sooner or later, \\\"Get on Up\\\" should have been his ticket, but \\\"Marshall\\\" while pretty good in most areas, just doesn\\\\'t feel like it has enough weight to it.I wish they did go with a bigger case of his, or just go all out and go with the one he\\\\'s known most for- Brown v. Board of Education.The movie becomes another case of a black man being railroaded by a biased and corrupt system built on fabrications. For some that may be enough to hold them; the court room scenes that take up most of the movie are often rousing if not predictable.This is all pretty easy-going though- by the second half it\\\\'s pretty much a comedy the lengths most of the white people in this movie will go to to hide their prejudices.At times it almost feels like their trying to start a Thurgood Marshall movie Universe here- like this one may not be that good but we\\\\'ll tease you with some of the better stuff to come if you want it.But even so, Boseman brings life to this character, whether it\\\\'s Marshall\\\\'s perceptiveness or his gift of gab, he\\\\'s cool because he knows he\\\\'s the smartest guy in the room at any given time.Josh Gad has his moments but he still can\\\\'t seem to fully get out of the goofy sidekick role. We\\\\'ll have to see how he does in \\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\\".Oddly enough this is a bio-pic that comes across more as a crowd-pleasing good time than something that\\\\'s going to be remembered at the end of the year, which is fine.I laughed, I was invested in the court trial mostly, the performances, including from Sterling K. Brown as the chauffeur are very good. Yet you just feel like it should have done more.So the score is 7 out of 10.

First there was James Brown the Godfather of Soul, then it was Jackie Robinson the first black player in modern times in major league baseball. Now it is Thurgood Marshall, but Marshall in his early days as a lawyer for the National Association For The Advancement Of Colored People.Thurgood Marshall in his career litigated many major civil rights cases including the most famous of all Brown vs. Board Of Education in 1954 that integrated the school system nationwide. Later on his career was capped by becoming the first black justice on the Supreme Court.This story takes place in the late 30s by the music and the radio broadcasts with the news of the day. Thurgood Marshall has been sent to Connecticut to defend Sterling K. Brown a black chauffeur on a charge of raping his employer Kate Hudson.This may be the north, but the racial attitudes in Greenwich, Connecticut are only more subdued than they are in Alabama. Fairfield County in those days in the richer suburban towns are pretty bad. You remember from Auntie Mame the phrase, Aryan from Darien. They're not crazy about Jews either.Marshall being an outsider to the state has to be admitted to the Connecticut bar. Local attorney Sam Friedman played by Josh Gad is the lead counsel temporarily and the first motion is to get Marshall admitted. That is usually a pro forma thing, note how Matt Damon has to be admitted to the bar in Tennessee in The Rainmaker.Such courtesy is denied Marshall by Judge James Cromwell. But he's allowed to sit at the defense table and coach Friedman. Despite a few curves thrown at the defense Gad who only did civil cases before this for insurance companies proves to be a pretty good advocate.Boseman steps up to his role just as he did with Jackie Robinson and James Brown. He also has some wonderful domestic scenes with his wife Keesha Sharp and at a nightclub with Jussie Smollett and Chilli Thomas as Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. Good performances you think these are the real people.Thurgood Marshall was also portrayed on screen by Sidney Poitier in the film Separate But Equal dealing with the school integration cases right up to the Supreme Court. These two really ought to be seen back to back for a full assessment of Marshall's career.In his time when Lyndon Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court it wasn't just race that made Marshall's appointment unique. It was the whole level of experience in the kind of law he practiced for people like Sterling K. Brown. The goal is justice and the law has to work for all for justice to be realized.Marshall is a film not to be missed.\\\", 'Thurgood Marshall was a legendary lawyer who became the first black judge in the US Supreme Court.Their is a good film to be made about his life, this is not it.Marshall focuses in one attempted murder case that he was involved in back in 1941 when he was a lawyer for the NAACP.It really is a modern version of To Kill a Mockingbird. A black man Joseph Spell is accused of raping a respectable married white woman who employed him. Spell then threw her off a bridge and left her to die.Marshall comes to Connecticut and teams up with a reluctant Jewish insurance lawyer Sam Friedman because the judge would not allow Marshall to be lead counsel.It is an effective courtroom drama, especially as Friedman is an inexperienced criminal lawyer who slowly discovers that there is more to law than insurance litigation.Chadwick Boseman shines as Marshall but there is nothing groundbreaking here as Marshall leads Friedman into the nuances of criminal litigation.', \\\"Marshall is a sleek legal drama with great performances from Chadwick Boseman as the title character and Josh Gad. Don't be fooled by the snazzy vintage costumes, the real heart of Marshall's success is its screenplay and the chemistry between its lead actors.This film follows pioneering Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in his earlier years as a lawyer for the NAACP. A white socialite in Greenwich, Connecticut, accuses a black man of rape and attempted murder. The NAACP believes the man, Joseph Spell, is innocent and sends Marshall to defend him. Marshall enlists local lawyer Sam Friedman (Josh Gad) whose previous track record involves tax or insurance cases. Friedman worries about his family's safety due to the unrest the controversial trial causes. Sam and Thurgood must work together to defend Spell\\\\x85and each other.This film is very good and so is its screenplay. The touches of comedy bring a welcome balance to its serious topic and difficult history. There is an array of good lines for Boseman and Gad. Several other actors get a chance to shine as well. I appreciate that Marshall takes its subjects seriously, but doesn't take on a dreary tone doing it. The scenes in the courtroom are intense and keep you interested in the action. As the case develops, these scenes get more and more engaging.While Boseman is very good as Thurgood Marshall, his performance is disappointing considering how hyped his portrayal has been in the film's ad campaign. He gives Marshall a suave personality but the script limits his ability to show off his range and really take the character on a journey. On the other hand, Josh Gad is a standout as Sam Friedman. He plays to his comedic strengths as Marshall's sidekick while also giving a genuinely good dramatic performance as a central and evolved character. He is a nice foil to Boseman and their chemistry reminds me of a buddy cop comedy.The lesson I take from the film is that you have to follow your moral compass even when it's hard. Sam's unwillingness to join the case makes sense. He is just starting out and worried that it could ruin his reputation. The fact that he does it anyway is a testament to the person Friedman must have been in real life.I give Marshall an age rating of 14 to 18 because of some racial and offensive language and suggestive and violent content, including depictions of the alleged assault. And my verdict on Marshall? 4 out of 5 stars. Marshall opens in theaters on October 13, 2017 so go check it out.Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.\\\", 'An exceptional story with great achievements and with great potential that delivers short in the movie, it could be a heartbreaking drama it could be an outstanding acting film but the played it safe, the cast, the screenplay, the pace, the script was just enough to make it work, yes the film is enjoyable, but without risks, just a great story captured in a regular but enjoyable movie.', 'A powerful, engaging, sleek legal drama based on the facts .. a true story.. About one of the pioneer NAACP lawyer and his role during racial tensions .. how Thurgood Marshall was there \\\"not to extinguish fire but to be one\\\" in his words.. commendable performances by the protagonists Chadwick Boseman and Josh Gad.. a must see', \\\"You would think it would be straight forward to come up with a provocative movie set in the US when segregation was in vogue. Not so! Roger Friedman is a decendant of Sam Friedman and a film critic who wrote an interesting article criticising the many inaccuracies in this film.So, the director and writers have an easy topic to critique history. They had a great man like Thurgood Marshall and some backward social attitudes that are as backward as our attitudes toward domestic violence today. Instead, the authors fill the movie with false facts and make Marshall look like an arrogant, unrefined twit (which he was neither). The directors and writers play the race card in all the wrong ways* and throw in a few sex jibes to top off a good dose of revisionism, undermining what could have been a great movie.As others have said, Josh Gad was the better principal actor in this movie. Sterling Brown as the accused was far more nuanced and capable than Chadwick Boseman as Marshall. Boseman is charming, but a totally wrong fit.I still give it a 6/10, which is very generous given the director and writers who totally failed to capture the essence of the story. The revisionist history and significant number of factual errors cast a large shadow over what could have been a great movie.Is the truth not interesting enough? The real Marshall is an amazing man - far better than Boseman's insulting copy.* Hollywood needs to curb its political correctness. I've banned my children from watching new movies until I screen them. That's how bad Hollywood has become. I know quite a few parents who feel the same way.\\\", \\\"I was hoping it would be a movie about the life of Thurgood Marshall. Instead it was focused on one case and didn't give much insight into Marshall at all. It was a decent movie, but with the life Marshall led, this can't have been even close to the most interesting story they could have told.\\\", \\\"It's 1941. Thurgood Marshall (Chadwick Boseman) travels the country as NAACP's only lawyer crusading for black defendants against the racist justice system. His next case is in Greenwich, Connecticut where rich housewife Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson) has accused her driver Joseph Spell (Sterling K. Brown) of raping her. Insurance lawyer Sam Friedman (Josh Gad) is recruited. He's reluctant and on top of that, Judge Foster (James Cromwell) refuses to accept Marshall into the local state bar. With Marshall silenced in court and with no criminal court experience, Friedman has to battle entitled prosecutor Loren Willis (Dan Stevens).This is a biodrama of one particular case with future Supreme Court judge Marshall. The story is compelling and the history is fascinating. The actors are all first rate. The actual court case does have some awkward turns. It's a thin line between blaming the victim and searching for the truth. It may help to definitively declare Spell as innocent from the start. This shouldn't be a courtroom mystery and should skew more towards underdog courtroom drama. If Marshall gets the truth from Spell at the beginning, he would come out looking even better. There are a lot of twisting that reminds me too much of a TV courtroom drama. I do love a lot of this movie but little things keep bugging me. For example, I love the kitchen knife joke but their kiss after temple strikes me as too much. I prefer a knowing touch and a sweet smile for her husband to drive home that scene much better. None of the little issues prevent me from really enjoying this well-acted compelling historical drama.\\\", \\\"I hate to say most, but there's a lot of biopics that are very formulaic in nature. And come to think of it, every genre deals with that issue. I can acknowledge that it's immensely hard to make a film that feels fresh and relevant at the same time. But I think the reason I tend to feel this way about biopics is because a lot of them seem to be directly aimed for the Oscar audience. And while that could be the case with Marshall, it's nothing less than a delightful film to watch.As with so many biopics, the main reason Marshall succeeds is Chadwick Boseman's unsurprisingly good turn as the famous lawyer, Thurgood Marshall. Whether or not Thurgood was this way in real life, I absolutely loved the sheer display of confidence in Boseman's portrayal. It was almost to the point of cockiness, without being arrogant. It's that balance that made me appreciate what this man brought to the table.Of course, there's also the dynamic of having a story that is still relevant to this day. Not only are people of color still discriminated, underestimated, and not believed in the court of law, but the idea of pitting race against race in the courtroom is something that is still unfortunately an issue today. So in a way, it was disheartening to watch the injustices happening throughout Marshall, as we know they are far from being over in the 1940's, but it's always nice to see something stick up for their people no matter what time period they are from.Boseman isn't the only one who gives a good performance as Josh Gad, Sterling K. Brown, Kate Hudson, James Cromwell, and a few others give valuable turns as their respected characters. I think my only issue with the film is that it ultimately felt very safe. I'm not one to know how these real life cases played out, but Marshall definitely feels like it took a guarded approach to the subject matter. Because of that, you can appeal to a mass audience, but I don't know that it was as detailed or thorough that it needed to be. Don't get me wrong, Marshall is a powerful film, but I think it could have taken an even further step forward into that realm.8.2/10\\\", \\\"Marshall\\\\nDirected by Reginald Hudlin. Written by Michael Koskoff and Jacob KoskoffI watch a variety of films. I like horror and thrillers but at the same time can enjoy a historical drama as well. This movie falls into that category. Marshall stars Chadwick Boseman(Black Panther) as Thurgood Marshall as he travels to Bridgeport, Connecticut to help a black man accused of raping a well to do woman. He is not allowed to participate in the court proceedings so his proxy is Josh Gad who is not a criminal defense attorney. This is all based on a true story. So it has that going for it.This is a perfect example of a fine movie. A fine movie is enjoyable. A fine movie has quality performances throughout. A fine movie tells a story that you can follow and you might even be invested in but a fine movie doesn't do more than that. This is an important story. It tells how Marshall has this last trial to get the NAACP going in respect to civil rights progress.It does all of this just fine. It just never engages more than that. It hits all the spots that it is supposed to hit when it comes to this kind of story. I hate trying to talk about movies like this. There is little to say because the movie tells it's courtroom drama adequately enough. It doesn't present with too much visual flair because the story is the most important aspect. I think it could have done with some melodramatics and some out there visual flair. It might have engaged with the pictures more than just the beat by beat it gives you.I realize that I've not said anything about Black Panther himself. He's alright. He doesn't look a thing like Thurgood Marshall but that's not a big thing in this case. Sometimes it can be off putting. Sometimes it can be at the expense of who the character is internally. This does that somewhat. The case is the focal point.I give this movie a C.\\\", 'A look at the career of Thurgood Marshall. Maybe more people will know who he is and what exactly he accomplished.Kudos entire cast was riveting!', 'Packed house last night at the AMC Lincoln Center Theater for the NY Times Film Club premiere, a crowd of old white presumably liberal folk with a noticeably Jewish vibe. What you\\\\'d expect from the Times Film Club, I suppose, but the absence of black faces was very strange, and put the whole experience out of kilter for me. The film seems aimed at a much younger and blacker audience. When, at the beginning of the film, Boseman offhandedly ordered Gad to carry his bags, and Gad complied immediately, the lone outburst of \\\"Whoa!\\\" fell into almost total (shocked?) silence. That set the tone for me. Marshall is flat-out superhero here, the master bringing sidekick Friedman rapidly up to speed on the state of the Real World. That Waking Up Friedman subplot runs in and out of the main courtroom rape drama, where Sterling K Brown and Kate Hudson nearly steal the show with their far more realistic turns as Spell and Strubing, and James Cromwell and Dan Stevens are skin-crawlingly detestable as judge and prosecutor stooping ever lower to defend the racist ivory tower of Bridgeport CT. How this will do immediately at the box office depends on a lot of other factors, including the trailers. But my guess is that the inherent value of the story, which couldn\\\\'t be more timely, will connect with audiences on a deep level, while the shenanigans on the surface keep them entertained, and the in the end they\\\\'ll put it together in their own way. I expect this will be a keeper, something that will be on TV and video for a long, long time, and that \\\"Marshall\\\" will enter the rap lexicon on several levels very quickly.', \\\"'MARSHALL': Four Stars (Out of Five)A courtroom drama/biopic about the first African-American Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall, and one of his first big cases. The movie stars Chadwick Boseman as Marshall, and it was directed by Reginald Hudlin (some fun trivia, Hudlin wrote the Marvel comic book 'Black Panther', from 2005 to 2008, and Boseman is now playing the character in the Marvel Studios movies). The screenplay was written by Michael and Jacob Koskoff. Josh Gad, Kate Hudson, Sterling K. Brown, Dan Stevens and James Cromwell all costar in the legal drama. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I enjoyed it.The story takes place in 1940 Bridgeport Connecticut. It revolves around Thurgood Marshall (Boseman), an NAACP lawyer who was traveling around the country defending people wrongly accused of crimes due to their color. He's sent to Connecticut to defend a chauffer, named Joseph Spell (Brown), who was accused of raping his employer, a white woman named Eleanor Strubing (Hudson). An insurance lawyer, named Sam Friedman (Gad), attempts to get Marshall admitted to the local bar, but the judge (Cromwell) refuses to allow him tospeak during the trial. So Friedman is forced to become Spell's lead counsel, with Marshall assisting him through notes and whispers. \\\\n \\\\nThe movie is a pretty routine courtroom drama, but it's much more involving because of it's social commentary (on the racism of that time). It's got a great cast, especially Boseman in the lead, who makes a very powerful and charismatic leading man. The film is involving, and aptly directed, but it's also mostly predictable. It's still a lot of fun to watch though, and movies about racial injustice are always important.\\\", \\\"As always, when I watch a movie based on real events, I try to compare to what really happened and I usually end up not liking the movie that much because of this. With this one I think they did an excellent job with the case, being pretty faithful to what really happened, with some details changed, but most of it is pretty accurate. Chadwick Boseman turns up another excellent performance as the titular Thurgood Marshall. The production design is impeccable and the courtroom scenes very engaging. So everything seems fine with this movie, with one notable exception, Sam Friedman, here played by Josh Gad. Everything about him is wrong and a total disrespect for the man. This case was mostly won by him with very little help from Marshall, which begs the question, if you wanted to make a movie about Thurgood Marshall why choose a case in which he didn't have that big of an impact, and change everything to make it look like he did? Why not make a movie about his most famous cases? I really can't answer this questions and it casts a giant shadow over the movie.\\\", 'Marshall appeared to be written to the audience of people who probably did not know very much about the early NAACP, or Thurgood Marshall in general. The movie did not captivate his pinnacle case \\\"Brown vs Board of Education Topeka\\\" or his ascension to the Supreme Court. The movie did not highlight any of his 32 cases before the United States Supreme Court. This movie was an introductory that raises one\\\\'s interest in the subject of this man, his contributions to civil rights, and obstacles that faced African Americans during this period of United States History.I would recommend this movie to people who are very knowledgeable of Justice Marshall, or perhaps not fully aware of the ramifications of his life\\\\'s work. Perhaps millennial, like myself, who cannot fully appreciate the journey and progress of civil rights, were the target audience of this movie.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and think it is currently undervalued. The actor who played Justice Marshall was great, the actor who played Mr. Friedman was excellent as well. I would also like to give a shoutout to the way the movie portrayed the residing judge of this case, because he was a very significant character and his transitions in the movie truly gave the movie a climactic moment that really resonated with me. I would recommend Marshall to any of my friends and thought it was great.', 'This film tells the story of a African American lawyer, who fights against social Injustice by helping people who are charged with crimes because of their skin color.\\\"Marshall\\\" tells a compelling story of the fight for the right and just. The story is gripping because it is not an easy fight. Indeed, the African American characters evoke much sympathy and really connects with the viewers. I enjoyed it a lot.', 'It is set in Greenwich, Connecticut, in 1941 and is \\\"based on\\\" one of Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall\\\\'s early civil rights cases when he was a practicing lawyer.Thurgood Marshall (Chadwick Boseman) is a young NAACP staff lawyer sent to Greenwich, Connecticut, to defend Joseph Spell (Sterling K. Brown) against the charge of raping and attempting to kill his white employer, Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson). He was said to have raped her, then bound her, and thrown her off a bridge. However, she managed to swim to shore and then reported the rape. Since Marshall came from out-of-state, he needed a local lawyer to be part of the case. Sam Friedman (Josh Gad) was a Jewish lawyer who only handled civil, not criminal, cases. He was initially reluctant to take the case. The movie depicts Judge Foster (James Cromwell) as biased and the prosecutor, Loris Willis) as an Ivy League snob. The Judge allows Marshall to sit the second chair but not to make arguments or question witnesses, so Marshall coaches Friedman throughout the trial.The movie then details the trial with flashbacks to illustrate Eleanor Strubing\\\\'s story and later illustrates Joseph Spell\\\\'s claim that the sex was consensual, that he had initially approached her for money, and that she had invited the sex. He said that Strubing only panicked after the fact and jumped off the bridge of her own volition. Friedman manages to raise doubt based on gaps and contradictions in Strubing\\\\'s story, and the jury ultimately finds Spell not guilty.This was quite a famous trial when it took place in early 1941. It was a front-page story in the New York Times when the incident happened (the story is in the December 12, 1940 issue of the Times.). Contrary to the film, Sam Friedman and Thurgood Marshall were much more equal than portrayed in the film. Friedman was a bit older and already had a reputation for theatrical performance in courts. He had been hired by the NAACP before Marshall got to town. Indeed, Friedman did act as the lead defense lawyer in the trial. Again contrary to the film, Joseph Spell had admitted from the beginning that he had sex with Eleanor Strubing but always insisted it was consensual. Strubing\\\\'s contradictory story included a ransom note that was never found and a rope said to have bound her hands that were never found. There were actual doubts about her story from the beginning. Nonetheless, it was a remarkable success story for the NAACP.This is an interesting film. The relationship between Marshall and Friedman includes humor and Friedman\\\\'s sensibilities arising from his own Jewish background. Chadwick Boseman is excellent as a self-confident black lawyer. Josh Gad is a good complement to the Marshall character.', \\\"Leaving aside the civil justice warrior biography template that's slightly overdone in Hollywood - this film works on every other front. The acting is exceptional, the script and storylines well selected.For a biography, enough shades of grey though there could have been more, the story is an important one. The direction and editing also deserves a mention. The character of Sam is very well created/portrayed and despite the high brow thrill of courtroom drama, it brings home truths and lies close to reality.If not for anything, it is a story of America, its history and its values told from the perspective of one phenomenal man's fight along the way. Watch it for the story if not anything else!\\\", 'Before he played the lead in Marvel Studios\\\\' superhero sage \\\"Black Panther,\\\" actor Chadwick Boseman played a genuine African-American hero in \\\"Boomerang\\\" director Reginald Hudlin\\\\'s \\\"Marshall,\\\" a sterling biographical courtroom yarn about civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall. As it turns out, this is the same individual who argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court and then later donned the robes as the first African-American to sit on the highest federal court of the United States. It doesn\\\\'t hurt matters that seasoned civil rights advocate Michael Koskoff and his son Jacob penned the screenplay. Interestingly, the elder Koskoff still serves as an attorney in Connecticut, where the trial took place in 1941, so he would know something about the hurdles that Marshall had to negotiate. At this point in his life, Marshall worked as the sole legal counsel for the NAACP, and his NAACP superior Walter White (Roger Guenveur Smith of \\\"Eve\\\\'s Bayou\\\") dispatches him to all parts of the country to defend poor African-Americans who cannot afford an attorney.\\\"Marshall\\\" depicts the title character as a sharp, savvy, sartorially elegant attorney who refused to be intimidated by anybody. Boseman has a field day incarnating this historical personage. Neither Hudlin nor the Koskoffs reveal a great deal about Thurgood Marshall beyond his dedication to the rights of African-Americans in a legal system skewered against them. Indeed, we do learn about the problems that Marshall and his wife Vivien \\\"Buster\\\" Burey (Keesha Sharp of \\\"Malibu\\\\'s Most Wanted\\\") encountered in their repeated but futile efforts to get pregnant. Eventually, she does have a baby. Nevertheless, Hudlin and the Koskoffs don\\\\'t let Marshall\\\\'s own life history interfere with the trial at hand. Mind you, \\\"Marshall\\\" clocks in two minutes short of two hours, but Hudlin doesn\\\\'t malinger. The trial in question takes place in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The authorities have arrested a middle-aged, African-American chauffeur, Joseph Spell (Sterling K. Brown of \\\"Brown Sugar\\\"), for allegedly raping a Greenwich socialite, Mrs. Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson of \\\"Deepwater Horizon\\\"), and then throwing her into a reservoir late one evening. According to Koskoff, when the press broke the story, one newspaper touted it as \\\"the sex trial of the century.\\\" When Marshall visits Spell in his jail cell, the attorney explains that the NAACP represents only innocent blacks. Spell assures Marshall that he did not rape Strubing. Furthermore, he has an alibi for his whereabouts when the crime occurred, and the witness in question turns out to be a white policeman who is prepared to testify.As the case unfolds, Marshall realizes that he lacks the appropriate credentials to practice law in Connecticut, so he finds a gullible but willing Jewish insurance attorney, Sam Friedman (Josh Gad of \\\"Pixels\\\"), to help him represent Spell. Friedman constantly has second thoughts about the trial and the dire publicity that may irreparably damage his budding civil practice. Nevertheless, he agrees to serve as Spell\\\\'s mouthpiece. Meantime, the abrasive Judge Foster (James Cromwell of \\\"L.A. Confidential\\\") refuses to let Marshall utter a syllable during the trial and threatens to hold him in contempt if he does. Throughout the trial, Marshall must coach Friedman because the latter hasn\\\\'t argued a criminal case. If these two strikes against our sympathetic, but snappy hero aren\\\\'t enough, Marshall discovers about half-way through the case that Spell has been lying to them. Indeed, Spell didn\\\\'t rape Strubing! Instead, he had intimate consensual relations with her, because her abusive, bad-tempered husband, John Strubing (Jeremy Bobb of \\\"Boy Wonder\\\"), often left her alone at night. Naturally, Friedman struggles to improvise, but he falls into too many traps laid by prosecuting attorney Loren Willis (Dan Stevens of \\\"The Guest\\\"), who is supremely confident that he will win a conviction. Of course, the good citizens of Bridgeport aren\\\\'t happy with both Marshall and Friedman, and they go after them with fists. Friedman suffers the worst, getting beaten to his knees, and walking away with minor scars on his face. Marshall grins at him and points out that the local press lumped him with Marshall as a crusading NAACP lawyer.\\\"Marshall\\\" qualifies as a well-made but routine courtroom drama bolstered by terrific performances and historical accuracy.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"poster_path\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 966,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"/5f28TXtvHioXirX2n1XH8EJ314v.jpg\",\n          \"/we449l0ZIgjJHDVFSrpnuYfp0i3.jpg\",\n          \"/2KfdXsXTCbMie0wB1mSmIX60C2F.jpg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"backdrop_path\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 966,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"/oiPUcD1IIZrYGTSIpvTmd3dRmPo.jpg\",\n          \"/sNPS1pf3riNWsuCAh1iDwup6iaF.jpg\",\n          \"/oZZeG88rulKn1i5Y2WoJqLCBoF6.jpg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"review_sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 936,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative']\",\n          \"['positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative']\",\n          \"['positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'negative', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'negative']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The action is very unique, while also evoking memories of the Wachowskis' work on The Matrix. I really enjoyed the Vangelis-esque score used throughout. It helped create that dark, futuristic atmosphere necessary for the story. Even if you think you see where the story is going, it manages to go in unexpected directions. Between the cool concept, great sets, and dark themes, Upgrade is just that, an upgrade to the typical revenge action thriller.\\\", \\\"Through and through this movie felt like a longer episode of black mirror. The production was higher and the cinematography was really cool. I could see how the stabilization lock on his head during fight scenes could make some people dizzy, but I thought it was a unique way of doing things. Some of the acting was sub-par during the casual interactions, but I thought the plot and action made up for it. It's thought provoking in the way Black Mirror is and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys that content and doesn't mind gore.\\\", \\\"This has seriously become my favorite AI movie to date. I can't believe it was low budget because it's impossible to tell apart from the unknown actors who all do an excellent job. I will do my best to replace its lack of marketing with recommeding it to everyone. I was expecting something entertaining and instead got an amazing plot with a mind-blowing ending. If you enjoy this genre, you can't let this one pass you by. What everyone says is true, it's like a long, perfectly executed Black Mirror episode. I rated it 10 stars for the simple reason that I could not fine anything wrong with it or anything I didn't like. From beginning to end, this movie is amazing. I cannot recommend it enough.\\\", \\\"Brilliant.This movie is proof that you don't need all the special effects in the world to make an amazing sci fi movie. This is low budget done right (think Ex Machina).I signed up to IMDB to review this movie, I was that impressed. I see tons of people making that remark about films but honestly, this movie is unbelievable and for any sci fi fan out there, you need to watch this.I went in blind, no trailer, no knowledge of the movie what so ever and I would advise you do the same.The plot is simple, it's a revenge story that's been done countless times, yet it feels so fresh, acting Is slightly suspect throughout the first 10-15 minutes but the story will grip you, be patient.Honestly, I don't want to give anything away so just watch this movie.9.5/10Easily my favourite sci fi for a LONG time.Enjoy.\\\", \\\"Upgrade is unfortunately in the club of great movies that completely flew under the radar when first released. But that might actually work to its advantage, as this is definitely one of those movies where the less you know going in, the better. The only reason I was aware of Upgrade is because of writer/director Leigh Whannell (Saw, Insidious), and the fact I'd heard plenty of great things from friends who'd seen it. The film takes the all-too-familiar premise of a man looking to avenge the murder of his wife, and puts an interesting new sci-fi spin on it. Whannell clearly loves the classics, because Upgrade's influences are easy to spot - RoboCop, Blade Runner, Dredd, Death Wish. They've all been thrown in a blender, and what comes out is something that feels like its own movie, while also paying tribute to everything that inspired Whannell to become a filmmaker in the first place. Upgrade is violent, thought-provoking, funny, surprising, with some terrific fight sequences, an awesome soundtrack, and a dynamite performance from Logan Marshall-Green. I also get the feeling I'm gonna love it even more the next time I watch it. Highly recommended for fans of sci-fi/action.\\\", \\\"Probably worthy of a bigger production as it's a great science fiction story with comedy action and a few twists.One of those pleasant surprises that you don't expect in an unknown film, I've seen far worse more well known and promoted movies, worth a view.\\\", 'This film is basically \\\"Robocop\\\" meets \\\"Death Wish\\\", with less satire than the former and more humor than the latter. And it\\\\'s a B movie blast. An unrelenting pace, fantastic fight choreography that doesn\\\\'t skimp on the gleeful blood and gore, and never not fun or interesting to look at.Yeah some of the one-liner dialogue as delivered by Logan Marshall-Green feels a bit forced and the plot isn\\\\'t exactly clever or unique, but damn it, it all works and it makes it\\\\'s own beautiful alchemy out of a bunch of borrowed parts. This is cheap genre filmmaking done right.', \\\"I admit to enjoying UPGRADE, a simple science fiction-oriented twist on the usual revenge storyline. I'll say straight away that the plot is nothing special and has been done plenty of times before; it's the use of familiar but new technology that makes this interesting. The identity of the villains and the supporting characters are quite perfunctory, but the direction is inventive and the film particularly shines in the action scenes, so much so that you wish there were more of them. The main actor commits to his part quite neatly and there are enough decent set-pieces to make this an enjoyable watch, more so than plenty of bigger-budgeted fare.\\\", 'After watching this movie you will realize how bad every other major sci-fi has been in the past several years. This is a film with an excellent story, great cast, direction is on point, and the sci-fi is well developed. The gore is in your face ;) but it adds style to the movie and depth to the plot which one realizes later in the movie.A classic to remember. Look forward to seeing this again.', 'This movie has a plot that we have already seen in many movies, it\\\\'s a mix between \\\"Robocop\\\" and \\\"The Crow\\\", so let\\\\'s say that something was very predictable except for the ending that in my opinion was unexpected. One thing I really appreciated were the fight scenes that use a very particular camera movement that gave the right power and importance to the blows, scenes shot really well. I loved the performances of everyone, especially Benedict Hardie and Logan Marshall-Green. Highly recommended film, it may not be the most original thing in the world but it has its strengths.', '\\\"Upgrade\\\" (R, 1:35) is an action horror sci-fi comedy written and directed by Leigh Whannell, writer of the \\\"Insidious\\\" movies, the early \\\"Saw\\\" films, plus \\\"Dead Silence\\\", and director of \\\"Insidious: Chapter 3\\\". This movie was shot in Australia and Whannell and most of his cast are Australian. However, with the accents and the sets, you wouldn\\\\'t know the movie wasn\\\\'t American - and with the (lack of) quality in the last two \\\"Insidious\\\" movies, you wouldn\\\\'t guess that Whannell was behind this gem of a film.Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green, looking a lot like Tom Hardy) is an \\\"old school\\\" auto mechanic in a near future where intelligent, driverless cars are increasingly commonplace. He\\\\'s married to Asha (Melanie Vallejo), an employee at a high-tech company. They live in a house that\\\\'s suitably high-tech as well, operating with voice commands and equipped with a powerful computer embedded in a table top. They\\\\'re very happy... until one night when they\\\\'re on their way back from meeting one of Grey\\\\'s clients, a reclusive computer genius named Eron Keen (Harrison Gilbertson). Their car crashes and they get mugged. Asha is killed and Grey is paralyzed from the neck down, with only his mother to care for him.Eron visits Grey and offers him the opportunity to regain control of his body, with the help of a neck implant called Stem. The surgery succeeds spectacularly, Grey signs a non-disclosure agreement and heads home, promising that, at least for now, it appears to the world that he\\\\'s still a quadriplegic. Grey quickly learns that Stem can talk to him (as voiced by Simon Maiden). Given the lack of progress by a police investigator named Cortez (Betty Gabriel), Grey takes advantage of Stem\\\\'s Alexa-on-steroids capabilities to find the men who killed his wife. Normally not a violent man, Grey finds himself overmatched by these men, who themselves are technologically enhanced, until he learns how Stem can also help him fight. But, alas, avenging his wife\\\\'s death isn\\\\'t as satisfying as Grey might\\\\'ve expected.\\\"Upgrade\\\" is a very appropriate title, given some of the writer-director\\\\'s mediocre movies - and as a comparison to other films in the AI subgenre. This one is a combination of \\\"Deadpool\\\", \\\"Ex Machina\\\", \\\"Transcendence\\\" and the \\\"Bourne\\\" movies, but still feels fresh and creative, visually and narratively. The occasional comedy comes from the combination of Grey adjusting to having Stem\\\\'s cells in his brain and some gallows humor as he pursues his wife\\\\'s killers. The film also features one of the best recent casts you never heard of. The high-quality cinematography, editing, acting, pacing, directing and screenplay (with some late-game twists) makes this one of the most balanced and entertaining movies of 2018. \\\"A\\\"', \\\"I guess you can call this a B-movie, but that's not always a bad thing, and certainly not in this case.It has it's moments and some originality, which is rare in todays Hollywood remake factory.As for the B-movie thing it's worth mentioning the actor(s). The main actor had a little... uhm... stiff delivery.It doesn't hurt the movie in any way, it's a nice use of your time, and I will most likely watch it again.\\\", '\\\\'Upgrade\\\\' takes up many familiar dystopian sci-fi tropes and fuses them into a generic revenge-action movie. And if you came for the action there is a good change you will like this film. The fighting scenes, involving a combination of (slightly overpowered) superhero physics and grindhouse-like violence, certainly look spectacular, especially considering the low budget. However, if you, like me, came for thought-provoking sci-fi you will probably be disappointed. It\\\\'s not that it totally lacks great ideas, on the contrary. By touching on too many interesting topics (humanity\\\\'s increasing dependency on technology, governments and companies experimenting on humans, and, of course, the rise of Artificial Intelligence) you could even argue that the makers bit off more than they could chew. What remains is a cyberpunk action flick that never really goes into depth.The same can also be said of its main characters, all of which seem to lack any emotional complexity. Even the non-enhanced humans in the story often seem to act robotlike. This especially applies to Eron, but also to Grey, who, even though he is supposed to represent humanity in a world dominated by technology, is practically emotionless throughout the entire movie. The underlying problem here seems to be the pace of the film. With a first act taking up no more than ten minutes, the film takes absolutely no time to develop the main characters beyond the archetypes of the \\\"stubborn technophobe\\\", \\\"brilliant but anti-social inventor\\\", and the \\\"happy-go-lucky wife\\\". Not to mention the machine-hybrid cliche supervillain, who is especially hard to take seriously. The limited time you get to spend with these characters makes it even harder to genuinely feel for them as the story unfolds.The film, however, does succeed in bringing to life a dark, grim and empty world that feels painfully familiar and realistic - a sheer contrast with the characters that inhabit it. A scene, for example, that clearly stood out for me was the one with VR-junkies in the worn-out apartment building; it beautifully captured the blurred lines between the \\\"real\\\" and the \\\"fake\\\" that we increasingly seem to experience in everyday life. But even during these rare brilliant moments, the film felt rushed and overshadowed by action sequences. Admittedly, the ending was pretty surprising, but this could hardly compensate for structural flaws of the film. All in all, I found it an unfulfilling experience.', \\\"What an unexpectedly brilliant movie. Lots of laughs, some moments that I almost couldn't look, fabulously different story line, last minute surprise ending, car chases, and brilliant fight scenes.\\\", \\\"I think that many of the reviews below have already summed this movie up quite well. It's a standard revenge movie, but with a sci-fi twist and some incredibly impressive fight scenes. It's well-paced, well-acted, has a solid script, and the plot is more interesting and complicated than you might think from seeing the trailers alone.One other thing I really liked about it was the director's vision of the near future. With a few little exceptions (like how a computer chip in your neck can make you defy physics and stand up without bending any limb) the world here is very believable and depicted in such a way that was visually appealing without going too far as to make it look too flashy to be realistic.Don't let the fact that this was made by someone who directed one of the Insidious movies bother you either. This is wayyyyyy better than any of those movies. Director/writer Leigh Whannell has really found his footing here and delivered a movie that's highly entertaining and doesn't pull any punches.\\\", 'Upgrade is a straight-forward, entertaining violent action film about our potential near-future, and it\\\\'s not all that pretty. This movie is just like a Black Mirror episode, a modernistic yet pessimistic view of how technology is evolving. Some are for it, others are not. The anti-technology theme here is quite clear: Asimov may have been right.First, what did Upgrade do right? Well it\\\\'s certainly intense, with some really sweet fight scenes and unique choreography. The camera work was fun too. It\\\\'s an engaging story, good acting, overall a fantastic movie if you love sci-fi and violence.However, there were some issues. For one, the fight scenes were disappointingly few and far in between. I may have been misled by other reviews, but do not go in expecting something like \\\"The Raid\\\" movies. Some plot holes were spotted, and on a personal level, I do not go looking for those while enjoying a movie. Additionally, the plot holes were as obvious as the plot was predictable. So don\\\\'t expect any ground-breaking story here.But its intentions weren\\\\'t to grab an Oscar in Best Original Script, or any Oscar for that matter. Its intents were evidently to entertain those who just wanted a great sci-fi action thriller without having to think too much, and to warn us of possible dangers lurking behind the excitement of the modern evolution of technology. So, I guess enjoy the movie, but be cautious of that thing on your kitchen counter that tells you the weather and controls the lights.', \\\"As stories go, Upgrade isn't anything particularly spectacular. There's some really good ideas of course, but the idea of cyborgs and AI taking over humanity are as old as technology itself. It also surprisingly draws parallels to a superhero movie released in the same year; Venom, where a normal Tom Hardy-looking guy finds himself possessed by an entity that helps him get what he wants by controlling his body. Where Upgrade really shines is in its execution. The build-up leading to multiple multi-layered twists upon each other lend the film an unpredictable narrative complexity, where multiple rewatches are guaranteed to illuminate more subtle complexities, callbacks, and foreshadowing.Something that really makes Upgrade stand out is Logan Marshall-Green, who offers a truly impressive physical performance that is both demanding and complicated to achieve. The controlling of his body by an AI leads to some stylish fight choreography, and Marshall-Green doesn't stutter in adding robotic, calculated movements to those scenes, while simultaneously acting in juxtaposition with his head and facial expressions. He's confused and bewildered while he slices a guy up with a kitchen knife, he brags and gloats while his body effortlessly dispatches of goons, he pleads with bad guys not to continue fighting while his robotic-moving arms quickly and decisively disarm and dispatch of them. He holds such an impressive disconnect between his head and his body that I couldn't even imagine how hard it must have been to develop such physical coordination while acting and making it look effortless at the same time. Marshall-Green has never particularly impressed me before, but he has now.Even further though are clever uses of cameras adding another dimension to the film's visual identity. The high points are, again, the fight scenes, where the camera is just as involved in the choreography as the actors and stuntmen are. To add an even greater emphasis on the disconnect between Grey's mind and his body, the camera often keeps him fixed in frame while the settings around him movie. He's just enjoying the ride while his body does the moving, and we're put in that mindset. The way they did it is mount the camera in a rotating frame, hide a phone on Marshall-Green's body, and get them to match orientation. When Marshall-Green moves, the camera moves with him. This becomes especially impressive when Grey ducks and dives, or does full-on back-flips, and the camera mirrors his movements perfectly.Beyond that, the cinematography goes a long way to make this low-budget movie look much more expensive. Lighting is dim and harsh, camera angles are conservative yet stylish, and the CGI is used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary, which has a knock-on effect of grounding an otherwise futuristic world without getting too lofty. The score by Jed Palmer is also fantastic. I was maybe a little disappointed that Whannell didn't go for a Saw-esque climatic track for the third-act revelations, but nonetheless the score is evocative of sci-fi movies of the 70s and 80s, with borderline synthwave tracks interspersed amongst more ambient sounds.Upgrade is a solid sci-fi flick that manages to be refreshing and unique despite its otherwise overdone story elements. It ended up being a better Venom movie than Venom. All it took was an imaginative filmmaker like Leigh Whannell. I honestly can't wait to see what he manages to do next. I give Upgrade a solid 8/10.\\\", \\\"'Upgrade' is a hybrid action/comedy/horror flick written and directed by Leigh Whannell, who previously brought us the highly successful 'Saw' and 'Insidious' franchises.It stars Logan Marshall-Green, who shall forever be known as Tom Hardy's doppelganger (seriously--compare photos), opposite Betty Gabriel, a rising star famous for her turn in the breakout hit 'Get Out.'While the acting and overall concept are both quite remarkable, there's an unmistakable clunkiness to the film, alternating between the dialogue, blocking, and editing.However, the cinematography is superb, especially on such a low budget, and the action sequences when the bio-mechanical aspect of the film are fully utilized simply aren't to be missed.\\\", 'I went into this with fairly low expectations. The trailer looked good, and the cinematography looked exciting. But the premise seemed tired and worn.*in a deep, movie-voice over voice* some guys kill his wife, and now he\\\\'s seeking revenge\\\".But this film surpassed my expectations, and was a well-worth experience. Not only was I correct about the cinematography being exciting and engaging, but the plot actually strung together compelling way. This film came out of nowhere for me, and now, it\\\\'s a memorable film that accomplishes the most important goal of any great film: gets the audience to keep wondering about it.Since I don\\\\'t want to go into spoilers, I\\\\'ll say one last thing: pay attention to the Foley artist\\\\'s work. The sound design is poignant and additive to the experience. It reminds me of the clever usage of music from Baby Driver. Nothing is wasted and is always enriching of the world building. With Baby Driver, the music was giving us Baby\\\\'s personal experience. Here, the sound effects give us Grey\\\\'s point of view. Didn\\\\'t experiences, but both are elevated through sound, masterfully.I genuinely want to see it again. If the trailer interested you at all, go see it. It\\\\'s worth your while.', \\\"Not a lot of buzz was made about this film which kind of landed in theaters with no hype. I saw one trailer at some point and knew I wanted to check it out. Logan Marshall-Green isn't exactly someone who is a leading man. Ryan Atwood's brother and a role in Prometheus are his most notable roles. So it was nice to see him as a lead, and a lesser known cast in this film. Overall, I felt the plot can be tweaked at some points but its a fun film.The film is about a man named Grey, who becomes paraplegic after he and his wife were attacked by a group of hitmen. He is approached by a tech innovator who puts a device in his body which allows him to walk and control his limbs again.. in a way. The device is actually a smart system called STEM and sometimes STEM is allowed to take over, especially when Grey is in danger. Grey uses this newfound ability to track down the men who killed his wife.Insidious: Chapter 3 wasn't overly memorable for me so I feel like this film is where Leigh Whannell puts a stamp on his film making style. The action scenes are excellent when they come. The chase and combat on screen are stellar. The film does well to use its futuristic setting to set a landscape for the film, which itself still feels modern. The film also has humor at the right times. Its not overbearing but when it comes it feels right.My main concerns with the film was the underdeveloped side characters and there's a bit of convenience when need be. The plot feels like it could have been worked in a less cloudy manner but its not a major detraction from the rest of the effort. Its a surprisingly different effort. We've seen this type of film before but the film still seems to remain fresh and fun. Not really a title people are going to talk about this year but its good fun and that's good enough.7/10\\\", 'Really enjoyed this movie. A very good dose of future technology and where it would lead us to. We are already seeing the birth of some of the concepts shown in this movie and like with any technology there will be good usage and bad.\\\\nI dont understand the bad comments on violence as it is \\\"indirect\\\" (without giving away).\\\\nFast paced and suspenseful. Logan Marshall-Green acted well without any \\\"overacting\\\" or showing off. Screen play and direction were very good. It is original concept and I did not see any connection with Death wish or other movies - not even close or people did not understand the movie?', 'Upgrade greatly exceeded my expectations: truly entertaining, and remarkably well produced. Great acting by the lead character. Stylistically speaking, it\\\\'s perfect: very good cinematography, amazing fight choreography, beautiful scenography and music, perfect CGI, and the overall \\\"feel\\\" of the atmosphere. Only 5 millions were spent. Often, you will not find that attention for scenography and CGI in Hollywood productions.\\\\nIn the end, it\\\\'s a little nice movie with a standard plot that nonetheless got me hooked: it got more and more entertaining, and then some more. There are many cliches, but that\\\\'s a plus: when the director is good, having a cliche smoothly inserted into the story is pure fun. Each of the main events has a reason to be and a nice explanation (sometimes, it\\\\'s quite original), so that the story never really feels that \\\"standard\\\".\\\\nThere are just a couple of minor holes here and there, but nothing like what you will read in some reviews: infact, the structure is perfectly logic, and if part of the audience doesn\\\\'t pay attention, that\\\\'s not movie\\\\'s fault.Ps: forgot to mention... I realized I never saw a movie depicting cyber-bio-implants or whatever. Blade Runner does not, Ex-Machina does not, Strange days does not. This movie finally does.', 'If you wanted to see \\\"Venom\\\" but didn\\\\'t want to be distracted by all of the high end special effects and quality acting from Tom Hardy then \\\"Upgrade\\\" is the movie for you\\\\nLogan Marshall Green puts in a brilliant \\\"I\\\\'m not Tom Hardy\\\" performance. His inner dialogue with Kit from \\\"Knight Rider\\\" is beyond reproach.\\\\nTwo thumbs!', \\\"After ten minutes I came close to switching it off, as I couldn't get into it, it felt as though they were spending too much time showing off future technology, however I stuck with it, and was glad I did, as it develops it really does open up, it became a wonderfully gripping and entertaining sci fi thriller. Very well acted throughout, a pretty original story, and lots of action scenes.The accident really does change the movie up, and the tone, it really is well worth a look, the ending may come as a surprise for some.Very good, 8/10.\\\"]\",\n          \"[\\\"I love Shakespeare, but I've also always had a soft spot for Ophelia. This reimagining of Hamlet is not faithful to the original text, so have an open mind and you may enjoy it. I don't generally like movies that apply modern sensibilities to classic stories and characters, but this one was tolerable. The acting was fine, the sets and costumes beautiful. Overall it was a fine film. But if you're a purist, don't bother.\\\", \\\"I don't understand why the reviews for this one are so bad. I found this movie quite enjoyable. The acting seemed fine to me and the scenery and costume designs were really lovely. I enjoyed watching this movie a lot. I suppose those looking for the traditional portrayal of Hamlet might be disappointed. I enjoyed the updated dialogue and storyline from Ophelia's point of view. Give it a chance - you'll likely be pleased you did.\\\", \\\"Hard to believe the hostility directed against this movie.\\\\nIt's not Hamlet, but another take on the story from the viewpoint of Ophelia. The director chose to show the protagonist as a strong women.\\\\nEnjoyed the character development and the storyline. Directing was solid. All the actors were quite believable in their roles.\\\", \\\"I watched this because I wanted to see what Daisy Ridley's acting was like outside of Star Wars. I had seen her in Murder on the Orient Express, but her role was relatively small in that. This film isn't incredibly exciting, but Ridley certainly gives a fine performance as a fleshed-out Ophelia. The other actors carry themselves well, in addition; and the period sets, costumes, and locations are convincing.\\\", \\\"This was enjoyable in my opinion. I've seen Hamlet. I've read the play. This is not an exact remake of the original work but I liked that it was a reimagining.In this film, Ophelia is our main character and we seen how things unfold from her perspective. Her role in the original work is a big deal seeing as she was the innocence in a corrupt court who was driven to insanity and then suicide after the deaths of the men she loved most. Suicide was her escape from all the revenge, evil and madness taking place around her. Here we see her much more resilient without losing her innocent nature. The basic plot of the film is still present but things don't go down the same way.I thought it was filmed well and the acting was good. I thought the concept presented was creative. I'm sure that a lot of folks will take issue and feel like it was to far removed from the original work but if you take it for what it is rather than point out all the differences, it was a good film. I say check it out.\\\", \\\"It is not surprising the name of the costume designer features so early in the credits because he played a major role in making this film so watchable. All those gorgeous costumes must have cost a bit but along with some splendid d\\u00e9cor, ecclesiastical and baronial interiors (and a few exteriors) and outdoor scenes of woods glades and hills this film never fail to offer pleasure for the eye. The story proceeds at a sufficient pace with some unexpected twists and turns while bringing out how empty and unsatisfying royal or any great power can be. Is it really worth fighting so hard for? Pity about the mayhem of the penultimate scene, it was unnecessary, but makes Ophelia's choice at the end seem a wise one.\\\", 'Critics seem to have difficulties agreeing on whether this is a spin-of of Hamlet to tell Ophelia\\\\'s story, or simply Hamlet\\\\'s story told from Ophelia\\\\'s POV. I tend to side with the former.\\\\nOne thing definitely reimagined here is that Ophelia is no longer a helpless, passive victim eventually driven to madness. She is all courage, intelligence, wit, spirit, resourceful, and more. And why not, if she is played by Daisy Ridley whom we know best as Rey, the new heroine in the third and final trilogy of the Star Wars saga that spanned the silver screen for over 4 decades. Incidentally, in about 2 months, our patience will be rewarded with the answer to Rey\\\\'s real heritage. But I digress.\\\\nAmong other things, this movie has a generous offer of witty word plays. Right at the start, when Ophelia as a child (Mia Quiney) is taken under the wings of Queen Gertrude (Naomi Watts), the first exchange includes the Queen\\\\'s mild exclamation of \\\"Alas, indeed\\\", which is turned by the witty Ophelia into \\\"a lass\\\", as she is often mistaken for a boy in her tomboyish childhood.\\\\nIn the first encounter (not counting stealing glances at each other at a distance) between Ophelia and Hamlet (George MacKay), she is fully submerged in serene lake water when surprised by him and Horatio on shore. Hamlet promptly commented that as she is a lady-in-waiting, perhaps she wouldn\\\\'t mind waiting a bit longer. They would not inconvenience themselves on her account with looking for another spot for fishing. Totally unruffled, Ophelia teasingly emerges from water in tantalizingly slow motion, only to have the jaw-dropping Hamlet finally discover that she is fully clothed (Horatio has already walked away in embarrassment). That is a most definitive establishing scene of Ophelia.\\\\nOther depiction of Ophelia includes \\\"she dances like a goat\\\" (as per the other ladies-in-waiting). B then, she is \\\"a girl that can read\\\", surprising Gertrude who immediately gets even as Ophelia finds that her bedside reading to the queen is not a book of religious devotion but passionate novels of romance.\\\\nIn this movie, the Shakespearean English has been modernized, exemplified in probably the best-known fatherly advice, \\\"Neither a borrower nor a lender be\\\". Here, what Polonius says to Laertes becomes \\\"Do not borrow any money or lend it\\\". Incidentally if you find the face of the actor who plays Ophelia\\\\'s brother Laertes familiar, you should. This is none other than Tom Felton, otherwise better known as Draco Malfoy in Harry-Potter-verse. But I digress again.\\\\nFor the top-tier star presence, in addition to Ridley and Watts, there is also Clive Owen who plays the usurping uncle Claudius, most likely with more malice than you have seen anywhere else before. Note also that Watts plays not just one character, but two! Entirely new to the plot is Mechtild, a mysterious witch from whom Gertrude obtains potions for preservation of youthful looks. She also carries a secret that affects the big picture but let me not spoil it. Similarly, I will not spoil the plot which initially follows the Bard\\\\'s but later throws in some twists.\\\\nAs mentioned in my \\\"headline\\\", this movie has aa art-house feel, but is not get overboard. The pace, for one thing, is brisk. The cinematography is first-rate, as well as costume design. There is much to enjoy, if this is your cup of tea.', \\\"I didn't know what to expect but I thought it was a pretty cool movie. I don't know much about Hamlet but I was entertained. Bravo.\\\", \\\"I read the book by Lisa Klein that this is based on as a teenager. I loved it, so I might be a bit biased, but I didn't mind the changes to the Hamlet story. I thought the costumes, sets, and everything where gorgeous. The casting is good and most of the actors do the best they can with weakly written dialogue. My other TINY complaint is that they changed the ending from the book where she ends up with Horatio.Also, ignore the people who complain about having actors of different races in a medieval story. It's the 21st century. I think it's okay to cast the actor who is best for the role without getting hung up on race.\\\", '\\\"Ophelia\\\" is a Drama - Romance movie in which we watch Hamlet from Ophelia\\\\'s perspective. She was raised by Queen Gertrude in Elsinore Castle and she had some feelings for Prince Hamlet. Passion, romance, vengeance combined in this movie.I found this movie interesting and different since it\\\\'s from a different perspective than usual. The direction which was made by Claire McCarthy was good and she presented well her main characters and the plot behind her movie. The interpretation of Daisy Ridley who played as Ophelia was good and her combination with some other actors/actresses created a good result. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Naomi Watts\\\\'s who played as Gertrude / Mechtild, Clive Owen\\\\'s who played as Claudius and George MacKay\\\\'s who played as Hamlet. Finally, I have to say that \\\"Ophelia\\\" is an interesting movie and I recommend you to watch it just from curiosity.', 'Never mind all the fake early ten-star reviews here--if you can\\\\'t tell they\\\\'re fake from the writing, click on the person\\\\'s handle and you\\\\'ll see that inevitably they have never posted about another movie before.This movie gets five stars for being well-produced, good-looking, professionally acted and crafted. I can\\\\'t argue that it would probably entertain less discriminating (and younger) audiences, esp. if they have no prior experience with \\\"Hamlet.\\\" (God help the high school student who one day is going to figure they can skip reading the play and do a book report just from seeing this film.) But if you ARE at all familiar with \\\"Hamlet,\\\" this is is pretty ludicrous. It\\\\'s not that it departs from the play in many ways; \\\"Hamlet\\\" is such a ubiquitous classic that it can certainly withstand and even welcome some imaginative, revisionist takes.(partial spoilers ahead] The probolem is that this particular take is that of a stereotypical current teenage romance-novel-slash-fantasy a la \\\"Twilight\\\" and \\\"Wicked.\\\" Poor Ophelia must of course be a spunky little rebel who only PRETENDS to go mad, won\\\\'t let men tell her what to do, and other things that seem more than a bit preposterous for a young lady in a medieval Danish court. Of course Hamlet is ALL about her, in a brooding, lovesick, tormented Robert Pattinson-in-\\\"Twilight\\\" way. Things are manipulated so crazily to make O. the center of this whole story that she even sees the Ghost of Hamlet\\\\'s father before he does! Because she is just that special.Gertrude is made to be bitchy and insecure, reducing Naomi Watts\\\\' performance; Clive Owen is solid as Claudius, and other performances are OK. But it\\\\'s distracting that another concession to young audiences is making the court multi-ethnic, as if there were many black people around in 11th-century Denmark or whenever this is supposed to be. It\\\\'s not that this is quasi-modernized, which needn\\\\'t be a bad thing; it\\\\'s that it\\\\'s done in such a stereotypical, shallow, trendy fashion that the effect is ultimately kinda laughable.You can\\\\'t say this is really a \\\"feminist\\\" take, because it\\\\'s too juvenile in its approach--Ophelia may be somewhat \\\"empowered,\\\" but she\\\\'s also the girl whom the Prince himself offers to \\\"walk away from it all\\\" for! She\\\\'s supposed to be \\\"tough,\\\" in a sort of Katniss-in-\\\"Hunger Games\\\" way, but she also gets to be Cinderella, too. If you\\\\'re getting the feeling from my description that this movie piles up way too many cliches in order to hit the target audience bull\\\\'s-eye, you\\\\'d be exactly right. But jiudging from the film\\\\'s reception so far, obviously you can OVERESTIMATE what your audience presumably wants, and give them so much of it that they feel condescended to. This expensive-looking movie is pretty much going straight to VOD, and that is because it is more 21st-century \\\"Gidget\\\" than \\\"Hamlet.\\\" Doing the story from Ophelia\\\\'s point of view was a good idea--and someday, someone may do it right.', 'As a huge fan of Shakespeare, I truly enjoyed this alternate take on the tale of Hamlet and Ophelia. The star-studded cast was a delight to watch deliver superb performances. The sets were absolutely breathtaking and the costuming was tasteful and evocative. The film was a rich feast of color and the music touched my heart. I found myself singing along with the theme and humming it after the end of the movie. I just love that a woman wrote the book, another the screenplay and the director was female as well. This definitely is a step in the right direction of telling \\\"herstory\\\" to take its rightful place aside \\\"history\\\".', \\\"People are very harsh. Okay it's not Shakespeare- no pun intended- it's still pretty fun if not heavy on the PC stuff. Naomi Watts in two roles is always dependable. Clive Owens is a bit scary, the wig ... worth a watch if you're fan fiction kinda person.\\\", \\\"Characters act like it's happening in 21st century: winking, rolling eyes at each other, etc. Ruins the authenticity of the period of time its based in.\\\", 'I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. It seems to have polarized movie-goers, many \\\"1\\\" votes and many \\\"10\\\" votes. I quite like it, the movie has an interesting story and is acted and filmed very well.I have the advantage of not knowing very much at all about Shakespeare\\\\'s \\\"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\\\" , the source play for the book and now the movie. As the filmmakers explain, this is a re-imagining of the basic story with more focus on Ophelia and Queen Gertrude, and what the complexity of their characters might have been. Die-hard Shakespeare fans most likely take issue, anything that changes from his various versions would likely be considered unforgivable sins.But taken as a story greatly \\\"inspired\\\" by the play, with some significant changes and trajectory for Ophelia, it works very well, at least it does for me. Not a great movie but certainly very watchable and suitably entertaining. Not a \\\"10\\\", not a \\\"1\\\", somewhere between those extremes.Daisy Ridley is really good as Ophelia, playing her as a reasonable but strong person. I don\\\\'t really know much of his work but George MacKay (mac-eye) works well as Hamlet and Naomi Watts as Gertrude.', 'There are so many expeditions into the forest and a cave that are made by Ophelia in this film that it is easy to confuse \\\"Ophelia\\\" with \\\"Dora and the Lost City of Gold\\\"!Tom Stoppard\\\\'s \\\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\\\" was a play and later a film that showed Shakespeare\\\\'s \\\"Hamlet\\\" from the perspectives of two schlubs who are given their fifteen minutes of fame. By contrast, \\\"Ophelia\\\" deconstructs Shakespeare\\\\'s narrative not only to unfold the action from Ophelia\\\\'s point of view, but it also completely reinvents the character and the narrative.In the bonus track of the DVD of \\\"Ophelia,\\\" one of the film\\\\'s producers described their Ophelia as a \\\"spitfire,\\\" and within the film itself, she describes herself to us as \\\"willful.\\\" The director, Claire McCarthy, noted a \\\"tongue-in-cheek\\\" stylistic approach to the Shakespearean classic in the way that characters and events are entirely changed.Some of the most outrageous choices were have Ophelia marry Hamlet! The ceremony takes place in the forest in the style of Friar Lawrence overseeing the ceremony of Romeo and Juliet tying the knot. The quick-thinking Ophelia is also making rounds on the ramparts of Elsinore late at night on the lookout for the Ghost. Ophelia and Hamlet are both aware of that eavesdropping is occurring in a crucial scene, so they begin to whisper to each other as Claudius and Polonius are listening in. This Ophelia also does not go mad, but rather feigns the madness, giving an award-winning performance of the staged mad songs in front of the court. But the most radical change is that Ophelia stages her own death, giving the impression that she has drowned in the river!The filmmakers clearly wanted to avoid any semblance of Ophelia as a victim. In the bonus track of the DVD, McCarthy reiterated how this Ophelia was to have \\\"agency\\\" in her life. She begins as a commoner, then rises to the level of handmaiden to Queen Gertrude, prior to marrying the Prince of Denmark, and ultimately living to become a widow and proud single mom!The film was directed by a woman, and the screenplay was written by a woman, based on a woman\\\\'s novel. The featured characters, Ophelia and Gertrude, were woman, and a new female character of the \\\"healer\\\" named Mechtild, is Gertrude\\\\'s sister, who is always available to provide poisons, potions, and cure-alls in her cave.To crown it off, there is the convent of St. Emilion, where women who are harassed at the court may flee to safety. The protagonist will in time avail herself of the sanctuary afforded by St. Emilion. So, when Hamlet tells Ophelia, \\\"Get thee to a nunnery,\\\" he is providing the most important advice that will help to ensure victory for our Super Heroine, turning her into an Ophelia for our time!!', \\\"Based on the novel by Lisa Klein, the film follows the story of Hamlet from Ophelia's perspective. The movie boasts of a talented cast, tells the story on a different and interesting point of view and has a great ending. Unfortunately it suffers from some script's problems and sometimes it isn't as gripping as it should have been.Rating: 6,5.\\\", \\\"As a rebellious and motherless child , orphan Ophelia (Mia Quiney) is taken into Elsinore Castle by Queen Gertrude (Naomi Watts) as one of her most trusted ladies-in-waiting and at the luxury palace she meets a young Hamlet (Jack Cunningham) .

Entertaining, engaging enough to hold my interest, with an interesting plot.\\\", \\\"I really don't understand why there are so many really negative reviews and positive reviews being downvoted. Is it Daisy? Is it that someone's approached Shakespeare from a new angle?I'll never find out the answer but it's a real shame.I really loved this movie. I wasn't sure on Daisy in this kind of role having only seen her in Star Wars before but I actually think she played it beautifully. I have seen someone else say they think this would have been a Kiera Knightley role ten years ago and I agree, but she would have ruined it. It needed to be understated. It needed to be timid as well as strong. None of that makes sense I suppose but in my head it does.I'm not a fan of Naomi Watts or Clive Owen but they were watchable and actually I cried for Naomi's Gertrude at the end.The costumes are gorgeous, the scenery and settings beautiful and the soundtrack is wonderful, especially the music playing over the ending scenes.It made me interested in Hamlet again.\\\", \\\"As a person who never read Shakespeares' work and is not familiar with this story, I think this movie was just okay.Pros - the production design and cinematography is kinda cool. There are some really cool shots throughout the movie & dresses, the location, they felt real.Daisy Ridley was pretty good as Ophelia, it was kinda nice to see her in something other than Star Wars.The film is overall not that bad and watchable at times, but a lot of the time I couldn't help but think it was just mid.The characters in this movie are very flat. Even though some actors tries their best and you can kinda see it, but the script doesn't explore or develop these characters that much. They didn't feel interesting other than Ophelia.

I wish they would make more of these movies that follow Thurgood Marshall's journey. The only negative thing is that it felt a bit long.\\\", 'Greetings again from the darkness. The question must be asked: is the movie worthy of the man? The man was the first attorney for the NAACP. He won 29 of the 32 cases he argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, including the ground-breaking 1954 Brown v. Board of Education (separate but equal public education). This man was a trailblazer for Civil Rights, and in 1967 became the first African- American Supreme Court Justice. This man was, of course, Thurgood Marshall \\\\x85 a man who unquestionably deserves not just a movie, but a really good and important one.Chadwick Boseman has taken on film versions of such icons as Jackie Robinson in 42 and James Brown in GET ON UP, so he likely jumped at the chance to play the revered figure, Thurgood Marshall. Mr. Boseman has true movie star screen presence, and supplies the young Mr. Marshall with a self-assured swagger that accompanies a brilliant legal mind \\u2013 a mind that refused to be ignored during a time it was desperately needed. Lest he be labeled a superhero, the film does portray Marshall smoking and drinking, while also hinting at his carousing. The common flaws of a great man.It\\\\'s 1941 and the young (33 years old) Marshall is the lone NAACP attorney, so he spends his time ping-ponging around the country fighting for fair trials for those African-Americans accused simply because they aren\\\\'t white. He works only for \\\"innocent\\\" people and his efforts during this time were crucial to the Civil Rights movement gaining attention and legitimacy. Most of the film centers on a case in Connecticut (no, not the Jim Crow south) where a black man, Joseph Spell (Sterling K Brown), is accused of sexual assault of a \\\"respectable\\\" married white woman, Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson). If you are reminded of the great book and film TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, you must know that those literary and cinematic standards are such that few can ever hope to reach.What follows is not one of the more dramatic or tension-filled cinematic courtroom dramas. There is simply too much levity for the film to be classified as a historical heavyweight. That said, the man and his story are fascinating, and though director Reginald Hudlin chooses a deft touch rather than a sledge hammer, it\\\\'s likely the wise choice if the goal is to entertain, while also educating the masses to Marshall\\\\'s early career. Josh Gad co-stars as Marshall\\\\'s co-counsel Sam Friedman, a specialist in legal technicalities within the insurance industry. Boseman and Gad have nice chemistry (at times it feels like a buddy movie), and as a Jew in those times, Friedman is himself stuck in limbo between staunch racism and acceptance by the white community.James Cromwell plays Judge Foster, yet another man caught between the old world he has lived in his entire life and the fast-changing society and legal system that permits him to silence Marshall, while also forcing (somewhat) fair treatment of the accused Spell. Dan Stevens (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST) is Loren Willis, the disgusted and disgusting prosecutor. This character is so cartoonish that the only thing missing is a neon necklace that flashes \\\"racist\\\" as he speaks. Sophia Bush has a brief, yet important scene and Sterling K Brown (as Mr. Spell) has the film\\\\'s most heart-breaking moment as he sits on the stand and explains why he lied.Director Reginald Hudlin seems like an odd choice for the project. He has been working mostly in TV since back-to-back-to-back bombs BOOMERANG (Eddie Murphy), THE LADIES MAN (Tim Meadow) and SERVING SARA (Matthew Perry). Mr. Hudlin has experienced more success as a Producer, having been Oscar nominated for DJANGO UNCHAINED. Here he works with the father and son screenwriters Jacob Koskoff and Michael Koskoff. The elder Michael is a well respected criminal attorney and legal historian, and certainly understands the expectations that come with offering a public look at a near- mythical figure \\\\x85 especially one as revered as Thurgood Marshall.This isn\\\\'t so much a movie about the icon as it is about a young man on the path to greatness and importance (he served on the Supreme Court from 1967-1991). The soundtrack is filled with jazz which complements the light-hearted approach, and further distances from any semblance of \\\"heavy\\\" or \\\"historical\\\". Director Hudlin adds a contemporary touch by having Trayvon Martin\\\\'s parents (Sybrina Fulton, Tracy Martin) appear in a scene near the end. On the downside, multiple upshot camera angles are designed to make his lead character look larger than life. The truth is, Thurgood Marshall required no help in looming large. Hopefully this mainstream approach pays off and many are introduced to the legacy of a man who is more than worthy of this movie \\\\x85 and another.', 'I got to attend an early screening of Marshall tonight. I\\\\'m interested to see how critics react. I have a feeling many of them will object to the \\\"paint-by-numbers\\\" approach to the film. While we have not seen Thurgood Marshall represented much in film, it does feel like we\\\\'ve seen this movie more than once before. But that isn\\\\'t really the point. I\\\\'ve eaten spaghetti and meatballs hundreds of times before. I still enjoy it each time, the same dish, so long as it is made well. And Marshall, while not reinventing any wheels, is made well. Chadwick Boseman leads a terrific cast that includes Josh Gad, Dan Stevens, James Cromwell, Kate Hudson and Sterling K. Brown. Everyone is there to give this very important true story some depth and weight. At the same time, the screenplay never gets too caught up in its own self-importance. While some very dark themes and tragic events are present, there is a sense of humor pervading much of the film. This makes the people and events portrayed in Marshall relatable, instead of feeling like we\\\\'re watching a group of untouchable, stoic historical figures. Marshall isn\\\\'t designed to inspire anger or guilt, instead it encourages us to examine examples of unity that have been used to overcome struggle. It has more in common with films like The Help or Hidden Figures, than more aggressive films like Detroit (though that film is very intense and impressive). I would say Marshall will play out just as well at home as it does in a theater, but there is something about seeing it with a crowd that in this case adds to the experience. The gasps of the audience when an atrocity is displayed, the clapping when a bigot loses his/her battle-it is a good film to enjoy with an audience. From a technical standpoint, the film does not go out of its way to impress. The cinematography, costume and production design, music, editing-all seems serviceable if not particularly memorable. In this case its the story and the figures it portrays that you\\\\'ll remember. 7/10.', 'Growing up one of the first influential black figures I learned about was Supreme Court Judge Thurgood Marshall. While my life didn\\\\'t veer in the path he took, it was a chance for me as a young black male to see the dedication and time he took to his craft and where it could take you. Almost 2 decades have passed since then, and found myself surprised to see a film finally based on him and his capabilities. While the younger me was excited, I found myself wondering how this film would hold up side by side with other black period films like itself in recent history.Thurgood (Chadwick Boseman) is working in the NAACP when he is tapped for a court case of the accusation of a black male rumored to have raped a woman and thrown her off into the river and left for dead. While he travels to Connecticut for the trial, he finds himself hard pressed given he is a out of town lawyer unfamiliar to the client, and is left to have a inexperienced attorney (Josh Gad) to speak on his behalf in court. While Thurgood knows most of the material and how to move in court, he has to show Josh\\\\'s character the way to observe things his way.The performances are all relatively solid by no surprise given the cast. Josh Gad is able to sell the inexperienced character almost having to be hand held through every decision made in the courtroom. Also the development of him progressively becoming more confident as time goes forward. The writing in the courtroom is interesting enough to keep you invested in knowing what\\\\'s the truth and the holes in one plaintiff and defendants stories.Alas, my biggest issue with the film is really the lasting impact. While it is perfectly watchable in the moment, I felt as if a story like this should have had more lasting impact than what I saw given it\\\\'s a film in a movie theater. It\\\\'s not as riddled with clich\\u00e9s like preceding films I\\\\'ve seen in the past, but misses a strong distinctive voice. For some the issues I had with Hidden Figures, I at least know who the target audience was for the film and what they wanted to take from the movie. Marshall doesn\\\\'t really have that same feeling. The writing is never bad, but never as sharp as it feels like it should be until the second half when more gets revealed.Marshall in a nutshell I would say is \\\"almost there\\\" as a movie. Fine within the moment but leaves a bit desired when the credits rolled. I wouldn\\\\'t turn anyone away from seeing this, but may be best suited seen at home.', 'This enjoyable and inspiring movie is a worthy contribution to the courtroom movie genre. It memorializes the great Thurgood Marshall (who later won Brown v. Bd. of Education and sat on the Supreme Court). The film brings to life a forgotten rape case in Connecticut that Marshall tried early in his career when he was the solo staff lawyer at the NAACP. The story focuses on the plight of a black man accused of raping a white woman and it highlights issues of racism in the courtroom and on the streets. The movie recalls the classic fllms \\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\\" (which also involved a black on white rape case) and \\\"Anatomy of a Murder\\\" (which also involved sexual issues and in which--like many real trials--we\\\\'re never sure just what actually happened and who is telling the truth). The writing is sharp and witty and the acting and direction are great. Particularly strong is the emerging partnership and friendship of Marshall and the local lawyer, Sam Friedman, who had never tried a criminal case and thought he would just sit next to Marshall during the trial and and do nothing. But the judge forces Friedman to conduct the trial with Marshall serving as his adviser--and he rises to the occasion.', 'Whether it\\\\'s the Godfather of Soul, the first black baseball player, or the first black superhero, it\\\\'s fair to say Chadwick Boseman is becoming one of the best actors of his generation.So there was high hopes for this bio-pic about NAACP Civil Rights lawyer and first black supreme court justice Thurgood Marshall.The film looks at one of the first cases of his career; a black chauffeur accused of rape by his white employer in Connecticut. Josh Gad is also in the film as a Jewish lawyer roped into being lead on the case when a judge decrees Marshall can only assist. This is important as the Gadd character has never tried a criminal case before.You keep expecting Boseman to get that nomination sooner or later, \\\"Get on Up\\\" should have been his ticket, but \\\"Marshall\\\" while pretty good in most areas, just doesn\\\\'t feel like it has enough weight to it.I wish they did go with a bigger case of his, or just go all out and go with the one he\\\\'s known most for- Brown v. Board of Education.The movie becomes another case of a black man being railroaded by a biased and corrupt system built on fabrications. For some that may be enough to hold them; the court room scenes that take up most of the movie are often rousing if not predictable.This is all pretty easy-going though- by the second half it\\\\'s pretty much a comedy the lengths most of the white people in this movie will go to to hide their prejudices.At times it almost feels like their trying to start a Thurgood Marshall movie Universe here- like this one may not be that good but we\\\\'ll tease you with some of the better stuff to come if you want it.But even so, Boseman brings life to this character, whether it\\\\'s Marshall\\\\'s perceptiveness or his gift of gab, he\\\\'s cool because he knows he\\\\'s the smartest guy in the room at any given time.Josh Gad has his moments but he still can\\\\'t seem to fully get out of the goofy sidekick role. We\\\\'ll have to see how he does in \\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\\".Oddly enough this is a bio-pic that comes across more as a crowd-pleasing good time than something that\\\\'s going to be remembered at the end of the year, which is fine.I laughed, I was invested in the court trial mostly, the performances, including from Sterling K. Brown as the chauffeur are very good. Yet you just feel like it should have done more.So the score is 7 out of 10.

First there was James Brown the Godfather of Soul, then it was Jackie Robinson the first black player in modern times in major league baseball. Now it is Thurgood Marshall, but Marshall in his early days as a lawyer for the National Association For The Advancement Of Colored People.Thurgood Marshall in his career litigated many major civil rights cases including the most famous of all Brown vs. Board Of Education in 1954 that integrated the school system nationwide. Later on his career was capped by becoming the first black justice on the Supreme Court.This story takes place in the late 30s by the music and the radio broadcasts with the news of the day. Thurgood Marshall has been sent to Connecticut to defend Sterling K. Brown a black chauffeur on a charge of raping his employer Kate Hudson.This may be the north, but the racial attitudes in Greenwich, Connecticut are only more subdued than they are in Alabama. Fairfield County in those days in the richer suburban towns are pretty bad. You remember from Auntie Mame the phrase, Aryan from Darien. They're not crazy about Jews either.Marshall being an outsider to the state has to be admitted to the Connecticut bar. Local attorney Sam Friedman played by Josh Gad is the lead counsel temporarily and the first motion is to get Marshall admitted. That is usually a pro forma thing, note how Matt Damon has to be admitted to the bar in Tennessee in The Rainmaker.Such courtesy is denied Marshall by Judge James Cromwell. But he's allowed to sit at the defense table and coach Friedman. Despite a few curves thrown at the defense Gad who only did civil cases before this for insurance companies proves to be a pretty good advocate.Boseman steps up to his role just as he did with Jackie Robinson and James Brown. He also has some wonderful domestic scenes with his wife Keesha Sharp and at a nightclub with Jussie Smollett and Chilli Thomas as Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. Good performances you think these are the real people.Thurgood Marshall was also portrayed on screen by Sidney Poitier in the film Separate But Equal dealing with the school integration cases right up to the Supreme Court. These two really ought to be seen back to back for a full assessment of Marshall's career.In his time when Lyndon Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court it wasn't just race that made Marshall's appointment unique. It was the whole level of experience in the kind of law he practiced for people like Sterling K. Brown. The goal is justice and the law has to work for all for justice to be realized.Marshall is a film not to be missed.\\\", 'Thurgood Marshall was a legendary lawyer who became the first black judge in the US Supreme Court.Their is a good film to be made about his life, this is not it.Marshall focuses in one attempted murder case that he was involved in back in 1941 when he was a lawyer for the NAACP.It really is a modern version of To Kill a Mockingbird. A black man Joseph Spell is accused of raping a respectable married white woman who employed him. Spell then threw her off a bridge and left her to die.Marshall comes to Connecticut and teams up with a reluctant Jewish insurance lawyer Sam Friedman because the judge would not allow Marshall to be lead counsel.It is an effective courtroom drama, especially as Friedman is an inexperienced criminal lawyer who slowly discovers that there is more to law than insurance litigation.Chadwick Boseman shines as Marshall but there is nothing groundbreaking here as Marshall leads Friedman into the nuances of criminal litigation.', \\\"Marshall is a sleek legal drama with great performances from Chadwick Boseman as the title character and Josh Gad. Don't be fooled by the snazzy vintage costumes, the real heart of Marshall's success is its screenplay and the chemistry between its lead actors.This film follows pioneering Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in his earlier years as a lawyer for the NAACP. A white socialite in Greenwich, Connecticut, accuses a black man of rape and attempted murder. The NAACP believes the man, Joseph Spell, is innocent and sends Marshall to defend him. Marshall enlists local lawyer Sam Friedman (Josh Gad) whose previous track record involves tax or insurance cases. Friedman worries about his family's safety due to the unrest the controversial trial causes. Sam and Thurgood must work together to defend Spell\\\\x85and each other.This film is very good and so is its screenplay. The touches of comedy bring a welcome balance to its serious topic and difficult history. There is an array of good lines for Boseman and Gad. Several other actors get a chance to shine as well. I appreciate that Marshall takes its subjects seriously, but doesn't take on a dreary tone doing it. The scenes in the courtroom are intense and keep you interested in the action. As the case develops, these scenes get more and more engaging.While Boseman is very good as Thurgood Marshall, his performance is disappointing considering how hyped his portrayal has been in the film's ad campaign. He gives Marshall a suave personality but the script limits his ability to show off his range and really take the character on a journey. On the other hand, Josh Gad is a standout as Sam Friedman. He plays to his comedic strengths as Marshall's sidekick while also giving a genuinely good dramatic performance as a central and evolved character. He is a nice foil to Boseman and their chemistry reminds me of a buddy cop comedy.The lesson I take from the film is that you have to follow your moral compass even when it's hard. Sam's unwillingness to join the case makes sense. He is just starting out and worried that it could ruin his reputation. The fact that he does it anyway is a testament to the person Friedman must have been in real life.I give Marshall an age rating of 14 to 18 because of some racial and offensive language and suggestive and violent content, including depictions of the alleged assault. And my verdict on Marshall? 4 out of 5 stars. Marshall opens in theaters on October 13, 2017 so go check it out.Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.\\\", 'An exceptional story with great achievements and with great potential that delivers short in the movie, it could be a heartbreaking drama it could be an outstanding acting film but the played it safe, the cast, the screenplay, the pace, the script was just enough to make it work, yes the film is enjoyable, but without risks, just a great story captured in a regular but enjoyable movie.', 'A powerful, engaging, sleek legal drama based on the facts .. a true story.. About one of the pioneer NAACP lawyer and his role during racial tensions .. how Thurgood Marshall was there \\\"not to extinguish fire but to be one\\\" in his words.. commendable performances by the protagonists Chadwick Boseman and Josh Gad.. a must see', \\\"You would think it would be straight forward to come up with a provocative movie set in the US when segregation was in vogue. Not so! Roger Friedman is a decendant of Sam Friedman and a film critic who wrote an interesting article criticising the many inaccuracies in this film.So, the director and writers have an easy topic to critique history. They had a great man like Thurgood Marshall and some backward social attitudes that are as backward as our attitudes toward domestic violence today. Instead, the authors fill the movie with false facts and make Marshall look like an arrogant, unrefined twit (which he was neither). The directors and writers play the race card in all the wrong ways* and throw in a few sex jibes to top off a good dose of revisionism, undermining what could have been a great movie.As others have said, Josh Gad was the better principal actor in this movie. Sterling Brown as the accused was far more nuanced and capable than Chadwick Boseman as Marshall. Boseman is charming, but a totally wrong fit.I still give it a 6/10, which is very generous given the director and writers who totally failed to capture the essence of the story. The revisionist history and significant number of factual errors cast a large shadow over what could have been a great movie.Is the truth not interesting enough? The real Marshall is an amazing man - far better than Boseman's insulting copy.* Hollywood needs to curb its political correctness. I've banned my children from watching new movies until I screen them. That's how bad Hollywood has become. I know quite a few parents who feel the same way.\\\", \\\"I was hoping it would be a movie about the life of Thurgood Marshall. Instead it was focused on one case and didn't give much insight into Marshall at all. It was a decent movie, but with the life Marshall led, this can't have been even close to the most interesting story they could have told.\\\", \\\"It's 1941. Thurgood Marshall (Chadwick Boseman) travels the country as NAACP's only lawyer crusading for black defendants against the racist justice system. His next case is in Greenwich, Connecticut where rich housewife Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson) has accused her driver Joseph Spell (Sterling K. Brown) of raping her. Insurance lawyer Sam Friedman (Josh Gad) is recruited. He's reluctant and on top of that, Judge Foster (James Cromwell) refuses to accept Marshall into the local state bar. With Marshall silenced in court and with no criminal court experience, Friedman has to battle entitled prosecutor Loren Willis (Dan Stevens).This is a biodrama of one particular case with future Supreme Court judge Marshall. The story is compelling and the history is fascinating. The actors are all first rate. The actual court case does have some awkward turns. It's a thin line between blaming the victim and searching for the truth. It may help to definitively declare Spell as innocent from the start. This shouldn't be a courtroom mystery and should skew more towards underdog courtroom drama. If Marshall gets the truth from Spell at the beginning, he would come out looking even better. There are a lot of twisting that reminds me too much of a TV courtroom drama. I do love a lot of this movie but little things keep bugging me. For example, I love the kitchen knife joke but their kiss after temple strikes me as too much. I prefer a knowing touch and a sweet smile for her husband to drive home that scene much better. None of the little issues prevent me from really enjoying this well-acted compelling historical drama.\\\", \\\"I hate to say most, but there's a lot of biopics that are very formulaic in nature. And come to think of it, every genre deals with that issue. I can acknowledge that it's immensely hard to make a film that feels fresh and relevant at the same time. But I think the reason I tend to feel this way about biopics is because a lot of them seem to be directly aimed for the Oscar audience. And while that could be the case with Marshall, it's nothing less than a delightful film to watch.As with so many biopics, the main reason Marshall succeeds is Chadwick Boseman's unsurprisingly good turn as the famous lawyer, Thurgood Marshall. Whether or not Thurgood was this way in real life, I absolutely loved the sheer display of confidence in Boseman's portrayal. It was almost to the point of cockiness, without being arrogant. It's that balance that made me appreciate what this man brought to the table.Of course, there's also the dynamic of having a story that is still relevant to this day. Not only are people of color still discriminated, underestimated, and not believed in the court of law, but the idea of pitting race against race in the courtroom is something that is still unfortunately an issue today. So in a way, it was disheartening to watch the injustices happening throughout Marshall, as we know they are far from being over in the 1940's, but it's always nice to see something stick up for their people no matter what time period they are from.Boseman isn't the only one who gives a good performance as Josh Gad, Sterling K. Brown, Kate Hudson, James Cromwell, and a few others give valuable turns as their respected characters. I think my only issue with the film is that it ultimately felt very safe. I'm not one to know how these real life cases played out, but Marshall definitely feels like it took a guarded approach to the subject matter. Because of that, you can appeal to a mass audience, but I don't know that it was as detailed or thorough that it needed to be. Don't get me wrong, Marshall is a powerful film, but I think it could have taken an even further step forward into that realm.8.2/10\\\", \\\"Marshall\\\\nDirected by Reginald Hudlin. Written by Michael Koskoff and Jacob KoskoffI watch a variety of films. I like horror and thrillers but at the same time can enjoy a historical drama as well. This movie falls into that category. Marshall stars Chadwick Boseman(Black Panther) as Thurgood Marshall as he travels to Bridgeport, Connecticut to help a black man accused of raping a well to do woman. He is not allowed to participate in the court proceedings so his proxy is Josh Gad who is not a criminal defense attorney. This is all based on a true story. So it has that going for it.This is a perfect example of a fine movie. A fine movie is enjoyable. A fine movie has quality performances throughout. A fine movie tells a story that you can follow and you might even be invested in but a fine movie doesn't do more than that. This is an important story. It tells how Marshall has this last trial to get the NAACP going in respect to civil rights progress.It does all of this just fine. It just never engages more than that. It hits all the spots that it is supposed to hit when it comes to this kind of story. I hate trying to talk about movies like this. There is little to say because the movie tells it's courtroom drama adequately enough. It doesn't present with too much visual flair because the story is the most important aspect. I think it could have done with some melodramatics and some out there visual flair. It might have engaged with the pictures more than just the beat by beat it gives you.I realize that I've not said anything about Black Panther himself. He's alright. He doesn't look a thing like Thurgood Marshall but that's not a big thing in this case. Sometimes it can be off putting. Sometimes it can be at the expense of who the character is internally. This does that somewhat. The case is the focal point.I give this movie a C.\\\", 'A look at the career of Thurgood Marshall. Maybe more people will know who he is and what exactly he accomplished.Kudos entire cast was riveting!', 'Packed house last night at the AMC Lincoln Center Theater for the NY Times Film Club premiere, a crowd of old white presumably liberal folk with a noticeably Jewish vibe. What you\\\\'d expect from the Times Film Club, I suppose, but the absence of black faces was very strange, and put the whole experience out of kilter for me. The film seems aimed at a much younger and blacker audience. When, at the beginning of the film, Boseman offhandedly ordered Gad to carry his bags, and Gad complied immediately, the lone outburst of \\\"Whoa!\\\" fell into almost total (shocked?) silence. That set the tone for me. Marshall is flat-out superhero here, the master bringing sidekick Friedman rapidly up to speed on the state of the Real World. That Waking Up Friedman subplot runs in and out of the main courtroom rape drama, where Sterling K Brown and Kate Hudson nearly steal the show with their far more realistic turns as Spell and Strubing, and James Cromwell and Dan Stevens are skin-crawlingly detestable as judge and prosecutor stooping ever lower to defend the racist ivory tower of Bridgeport CT. How this will do immediately at the box office depends on a lot of other factors, including the trailers. But my guess is that the inherent value of the story, which couldn\\\\'t be more timely, will connect with audiences on a deep level, while the shenanigans on the surface keep them entertained, and the in the end they\\\\'ll put it together in their own way. I expect this will be a keeper, something that will be on TV and video for a long, long time, and that \\\"Marshall\\\" will enter the rap lexicon on several levels very quickly.', \\\"'MARSHALL': Four Stars (Out of Five)A courtroom drama/biopic about the first African-American Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall, and one of his first big cases. The movie stars Chadwick Boseman as Marshall, and it was directed by Reginald Hudlin (some fun trivia, Hudlin wrote the Marvel comic book 'Black Panther', from 2005 to 2008, and Boseman is now playing the character in the Marvel Studios movies). The screenplay was written by Michael and Jacob Koskoff. Josh Gad, Kate Hudson, Sterling K. Brown, Dan Stevens and James Cromwell all costar in the legal drama. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I enjoyed it.The story takes place in 1940 Bridgeport Connecticut. It revolves around Thurgood Marshall (Boseman), an NAACP lawyer who was traveling around the country defending people wrongly accused of crimes due to their color. He's sent to Connecticut to defend a chauffer, named Joseph Spell (Brown), who was accused of raping his employer, a white woman named Eleanor Strubing (Hudson). An insurance lawyer, named Sam Friedman (Gad), attempts to get Marshall admitted to the local bar, but the judge (Cromwell) refuses to allow him tospeak during the trial. So Friedman is forced to become Spell's lead counsel, with Marshall assisting him through notes and whispers. \\\\n \\\\nThe movie is a pretty routine courtroom drama, but it's much more involving because of it's social commentary (on the racism of that time). It's got a great cast, especially Boseman in the lead, who makes a very powerful and charismatic leading man. The film is involving, and aptly directed, but it's also mostly predictable. It's still a lot of fun to watch though, and movies about racial injustice are always important.\\\", \\\"As always, when I watch a movie based on real events, I try to compare to what really happened and I usually end up not liking the movie that much because of this. With this one I think they did an excellent job with the case, being pretty faithful to what really happened, with some details changed, but most of it is pretty accurate. Chadwick Boseman turns up another excellent performance as the titular Thurgood Marshall. The production design is impeccable and the courtroom scenes very engaging. So everything seems fine with this movie, with one notable exception, Sam Friedman, here played by Josh Gad. Everything about him is wrong and a total disrespect for the man. This case was mostly won by him with very little help from Marshall, which begs the question, if you wanted to make a movie about Thurgood Marshall why choose a case in which he didn't have that big of an impact, and change everything to make it look like he did? Why not make a movie about his most famous cases? I really can't answer this questions and it casts a giant shadow over the movie.\\\", 'Marshall appeared to be written to the audience of people who probably did not know very much about the early NAACP, or Thurgood Marshall in general. The movie did not captivate his pinnacle case \\\"Brown vs Board of Education Topeka\\\" or his ascension to the Supreme Court. The movie did not highlight any of his 32 cases before the United States Supreme Court. This movie was an introductory that raises one\\\\'s interest in the subject of this man, his contributions to civil rights, and obstacles that faced African Americans during this period of United States History.I would recommend this movie to people who are very knowledgeable of Justice Marshall, or perhaps not fully aware of the ramifications of his life\\\\'s work. Perhaps millennial, like myself, who cannot fully appreciate the journey and progress of civil rights, were the target audience of this movie.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and think it is currently undervalued. The actor who played Justice Marshall was great, the actor who played Mr. Friedman was excellent as well. I would also like to give a shoutout to the way the movie portrayed the residing judge of this case, because he was a very significant character and his transitions in the movie truly gave the movie a climactic moment that really resonated with me. I would recommend Marshall to any of my friends and thought it was great.', 'This film tells the story of a African American lawyer, who fights against social Injustice by helping people who are charged with crimes because of their skin color.\\\"Marshall\\\" tells a compelling story of the fight for the right and just. The story is gripping because it is not an easy fight. Indeed, the African American characters evoke much sympathy and really connects with the viewers. I enjoyed it a lot.', 'It is set in Greenwich, Connecticut, in 1941 and is \\\"based on\\\" one of Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall\\\\'s early civil rights cases when he was a practicing lawyer.Thurgood Marshall (Chadwick Boseman) is a young NAACP staff lawyer sent to Greenwich, Connecticut, to defend Joseph Spell (Sterling K. Brown) against the charge of raping and attempting to kill his white employer, Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson). He was said to have raped her, then bound her, and thrown her off a bridge. However, she managed to swim to shore and then reported the rape. Since Marshall came from out-of-state, he needed a local lawyer to be part of the case. Sam Friedman (Josh Gad) was a Jewish lawyer who only handled civil, not criminal, cases. He was initially reluctant to take the case. The movie depicts Judge Foster (James Cromwell) as biased and the prosecutor, Loris Willis) as an Ivy League snob. The Judge allows Marshall to sit the second chair but not to make arguments or question witnesses, so Marshall coaches Friedman throughout the trial.The movie then details the trial with flashbacks to illustrate Eleanor Strubing\\\\'s story and later illustrates Joseph Spell\\\\'s claim that the sex was consensual, that he had initially approached her for money, and that she had invited the sex. He said that Strubing only panicked after the fact and jumped off the bridge of her own volition. Friedman manages to raise doubt based on gaps and contradictions in Strubing\\\\'s story, and the jury ultimately finds Spell not guilty.This was quite a famous trial when it took place in early 1941. It was a front-page story in the New York Times when the incident happened (the story is in the December 12, 1940 issue of the Times.). Contrary to the film, Sam Friedman and Thurgood Marshall were much more equal than portrayed in the film. Friedman was a bit older and already had a reputation for theatrical performance in courts. He had been hired by the NAACP before Marshall got to town. Indeed, Friedman did act as the lead defense lawyer in the trial. Again contrary to the film, Joseph Spell had admitted from the beginning that he had sex with Eleanor Strubing but always insisted it was consensual. Strubing\\\\'s contradictory story included a ransom note that was never found and a rope said to have bound her hands that were never found. There were actual doubts about her story from the beginning. Nonetheless, it was a remarkable success story for the NAACP.This is an interesting film. The relationship between Marshall and Friedman includes humor and Friedman\\\\'s sensibilities arising from his own Jewish background. Chadwick Boseman is excellent as a self-confident black lawyer. Josh Gad is a good complement to the Marshall character.', \\\"Leaving aside the civil justice warrior biography template that's slightly overdone in Hollywood - this film works on every other front. The acting is exceptional, the script and storylines well selected.For a biography, enough shades of grey though there could have been more, the story is an important one. The direction and editing also deserves a mention. The character of Sam is very well created/portrayed and despite the high brow thrill of courtroom drama, it brings home truths and lies close to reality.If not for anything, it is a story of America, its history and its values told from the perspective of one phenomenal man's fight along the way. Watch it for the story if not anything else!\\\", 'Before he played the lead in Marvel Studios\\\\' superhero sage \\\"Black Panther,\\\" actor Chadwick Boseman played a genuine African-American hero in \\\"Boomerang\\\" director Reginald Hudlin\\\\'s \\\"Marshall,\\\" a sterling biographical courtroom yarn about civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall. As it turns out, this is the same individual who argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court and then later donned the robes as the first African-American to sit on the highest federal court of the United States. It doesn\\\\'t hurt matters that seasoned civil rights advocate Michael Koskoff and his son Jacob penned the screenplay. Interestingly, the elder Koskoff still serves as an attorney in Connecticut, where the trial took place in 1941, so he would know something about the hurdles that Marshall had to negotiate. At this point in his life, Marshall worked as the sole legal counsel for the NAACP, and his NAACP superior Walter White (Roger Guenveur Smith of \\\"Eve\\\\'s Bayou\\\") dispatches him to all parts of the country to defend poor African-Americans who cannot afford an attorney.\\\"Marshall\\\" depicts the title character as a sharp, savvy, sartorially elegant attorney who refused to be intimidated by anybody. Boseman has a field day incarnating this historical personage. Neither Hudlin nor the Koskoffs reveal a great deal about Thurgood Marshall beyond his dedication to the rights of African-Americans in a legal system skewered against them. Indeed, we do learn about the problems that Marshall and his wife Vivien \\\"Buster\\\" Burey (Keesha Sharp of \\\"Malibu\\\\'s Most Wanted\\\") encountered in their repeated but futile efforts to get pregnant. Eventually, she does have a baby. Nevertheless, Hudlin and the Koskoffs don\\\\'t let Marshall\\\\'s own life history interfere with the trial at hand. Mind you, \\\"Marshall\\\" clocks in two minutes short of two hours, but Hudlin doesn\\\\'t malinger. The trial in question takes place in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The authorities have arrested a middle-aged, African-American chauffeur, Joseph Spell (Sterling K. Brown of \\\"Brown Sugar\\\"), for allegedly raping a Greenwich socialite, Mrs. Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson of \\\"Deepwater Horizon\\\"), and then throwing her into a reservoir late one evening. According to Koskoff, when the press broke the story, one newspaper touted it as \\\"the sex trial of the century.\\\" When Marshall visits Spell in his jail cell, the attorney explains that the NAACP represents only innocent blacks. Spell assures Marshall that he did not rape Strubing. Furthermore, he has an alibi for his whereabouts when the crime occurred, and the witness in question turns out to be a white policeman who is prepared to testify.As the case unfolds, Marshall realizes that he lacks the appropriate credentials to practice law in Connecticut, so he finds a gullible but willing Jewish insurance attorney, Sam Friedman (Josh Gad of \\\"Pixels\\\"), to help him represent Spell. Friedman constantly has second thoughts about the trial and the dire publicity that may irreparably damage his budding civil practice. Nevertheless, he agrees to serve as Spell\\\\'s mouthpiece. Meantime, the abrasive Judge Foster (James Cromwell of \\\"L.A. Confidential\\\") refuses to let Marshall utter a syllable during the trial and threatens to hold him in contempt if he does. Throughout the trial, Marshall must coach Friedman because the latter hasn\\\\'t argued a criminal case. If these two strikes against our sympathetic, but snappy hero aren\\\\'t enough, Marshall discovers about half-way through the case that Spell has been lying to them. Indeed, Spell didn\\\\'t rape Strubing! Instead, he had intimate consensual relations with her, because her abusive, bad-tempered husband, John Strubing (Jeremy Bobb of \\\"Boy Wonder\\\"), often left her alone at night. Naturally, Friedman struggles to improvise, but he falls into too many traps laid by prosecuting attorney Loren Willis (Dan Stevens of \\\"The Guest\\\"), who is supremely confident that he will win a conviction. Of course, the good citizens of Bridgeport aren\\\\'t happy with both Marshall and Friedman, and they go after them with fists. Friedman suffers the worst, getting beaten to his knees, and walking away with minor scars on his face. Marshall grins at him and points out that the local press lumped him with Marshall as a crusading NAACP lawyer.\\\"Marshall\\\" qualifies as a well-made but routine courtroom drama bolstered by terrific performances and historical accuracy.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"poster_path\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 966,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"/5f28TXtvHioXirX2n1XH8EJ314v.jpg\",\n          \"/we449l0ZIgjJHDVFSrpnuYfp0i3.jpg\",\n          \"/2KfdXsXTCbMie0wB1mSmIX60C2F.jpg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"backdrop_path\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 966,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"/oiPUcD1IIZrYGTSIpvTmd3dRmPo.jpg\",\n          \"/sNPS1pf3riNWsuCAh1iDwup6iaF.jpg\",\n          \"/oZZeG88rulKn1i5Y2WoJqLCBoF6.jpg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"review_sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 936,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative']\",\n          \"['positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative']\",\n          \"['positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'negative', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'negative']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 966,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"You are a seasoned movie critic and insightful social analyst.

Reviews: \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\t1. I went into this movie having no clue what it was about and wasn't expecting much, but I loved it.There are innumerable movies with huge budgets that simply fall flat, and Upgrade, with a Budget of around $5,000,000, which doesn't cover the cost of catering on some of these huge budgeted flops, honestly looked like it cost a lot more than it actually did.Intelligent script, good action, very few unnecessary scenes, and though I thought it was sure to let me down, a very good ending.And although I have seen much of Logan Marshall-Green's work and was never a huge fan, he does a very good job here.Recommended.\\n\\t2. I'll give this film credit for putting a fresh spin on the overdone revenge film. The action is very unique, while also evoking memories of the Wachowskis' work on The Matrix. I really enjoyed the Vangelis-esque score used throughout. It helped create that dark, futuristic atmosphere necessary for the story. Even if you think you see where the story is going, it manages to go in unexpected directions. Between the cool concept, great sets, and dark themes, Upgrade is just that, an upgrade to the typical revenge action thriller.\\n\\t3. Through and through this movie felt like a longer episode of black mirror. The production was higher and the cinematography was really cool. I could see how the stabilization lock on his head during fight scenes could make some people dizzy, but I thought it was a unique way of doing things. Some of the acting was sub-par during the casual interactions, but I thought the plot and action made up for it. It's thought provoking in the way Black Mirror is and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys that content and doesn't mind gore.\\n\\t4. This has seriously become my favorite AI movie to date. I can't believe it was low budget because it's impossible to tell apart from the unknown actors who all do an excellent job. I will do my best to replace its lack of marketing with recommeding it to everyone. I was expecting something entertaining and instead got an amazing plot with a mind-blowing ending. If you enjoy this genre, you can't let this one pass you by. What everyone says is true, it's like a long, perfectly executed Black Mirror episode. I rated it 10 stars for the simple reason that I could not fine anything wrong with it or anything I didn't like. From beginning to end, this movie is amazing. I cannot recommend it enough.\\n\\t5. Brilliant.This movie is proof that you don't need all the special effects in the world to make an amazing sci fi movie. This is low budget done right (think Ex Machina).I signed up to IMDB to review this movie, I was that impressed. I see tons of people making that remark about films but honestly, this movie is unbelievable and for any sci fi fan out there, you need to watch this.I went in blind, no trailer, no knowledge of the movie what so ever and I would advise you do the same.The plot is simple, it's a revenge story that's been done countless times, yet it feels so fresh, acting Is slightly suspect throughout the first 10-15 minutes but the story will grip you, be patient.Honestly, I don't want to give anything away so just watch this movie.9.5/10Easily my favourite sci fi for a LONG time.Enjoy.\\n\\t6. Upgrade is unfortunately in the club of great movies that completely flew under the radar when first released. But that might actually work to its advantage, as this is definitely one of those movies where the less you know going in, the better. The only reason I was aware of Upgrade is because of writer/director Leigh Whannell (Saw, Insidious), and the fact I'd heard plenty of great things from friends who'd seen it. The film takes the all-too-familiar premise of a man looking to avenge the murder of his wife, and puts an interesting new sci-fi spin on it. Whannell clearly loves the classics, because Upgrade's influences are easy to spot - RoboCop, Blade Runner, Dredd, Death Wish. They've all been thrown in a blender, and what comes out is something that feels like its own movie, while also paying tribute to everything that inspired Whannell to become a filmmaker in the first place. Upgrade is violent, thought-provoking, funny, surprising, with some terrific fight sequences, an awesome soundtrack, and a dynamite performance from Logan Marshall-Green. I also get the feeling I'm gonna love it even more the next time I watch it. Highly recommended for fans of sci-fi/action.\\n\\t7. Probably worthy of a bigger production as it's a great science fiction story with comedy action and a few twists.One of those pleasant surprises that you don't expect in an unknown film, I've seen far worse more well known and promoted movies, worth a view.\\n\\t8. This film is basically \\\"Robocop\\\" meets \\\"Death Wish\\\", with less satire than the former and more humor than the latter. And it's a B movie blast. An unrelenting pace, fantastic fight choreography that doesn't skimp on the gleeful blood and gore, and never not fun or interesting to look at.Yeah some of the one-liner dialogue as delivered by Logan Marshall-Green feels a bit forced and the plot isn't exactly clever or unique, but damn it, it all works and it makes it's own beautiful alchemy out of a bunch of borrowed parts. This is cheap genre filmmaking done right.\\n\\t9. I admit to enjoying UPGRADE, a simple science fiction-oriented twist on the usual revenge storyline. I'll say straight away that the plot is nothing special and has been done plenty of times before; it's the use of familiar but new technology that makes this interesting. The identity of the villains and the supporting characters are quite perfunctory, but the direction is inventive and the film particularly shines in the action scenes, so much so that you wish there were more of them. The main actor commits to his part quite neatly and there are enough decent set-pieces to make this an enjoyable watch, more so than plenty of bigger-budgeted fare.\\n\\t10. After watching this movie you will realize how bad every other major sci-fi has been in the past several years. This is a film with an excellent story, great cast, direction is on point, and the sci-fi is well developed. The gore is in your face ;) but it adds style to the movie and depth to the plot which one realizes later in the movie.A classic to remember. Look forward to seeing this again.\\n\\t11. This movie has a plot that we have already seen in many movies, it's a mix between \\\"Robocop\\\" and \\\"The Crow\\\", so let's say that something was very predictable except for the ending that in my opinion was unexpected. One thing I really appreciated were the fight scenes that use a very particular camera movement that gave the right power and importance to the blows, scenes shot really well. I loved the performances of everyone, especially Benedict Hardie and Logan Marshall-Green. Highly recommended film, it may not be the most original thing in the world but it has its strengths.\\n\\t12. \\\"Upgrade\\\" (R, 1:35) is an action horror sci-fi comedy written and directed by Leigh Whannell, writer of the \\\"Insidious\\\" movies, the early \\\"Saw\\\" films, plus \\\"Dead Silence\\\", and director of \\\"Insidious: Chapter 3\\\". This movie was shot in Australia and Whannell and most of his cast are Australian. However, with the accents and the sets, you wouldn't know the movie wasn't American - and with the (lack of) quality in the last two \\\"Insidious\\\" movies, you wouldn't guess that Whannell was behind this gem of a film.Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green, looking a lot like Tom Hardy) is an \\\"old school\\\" auto mechanic in a near future where intelligent, driverless cars are increasingly commonplace. He's married to Asha (Melanie Vallejo), an employee at a high-tech company. They live in a house that's suitably high-tech as well, operating with voice commands and equipped with a powerful computer embedded in a table top. They're very happy... until one night when they're on their way back from meeting one of Grey's clients, a reclusive computer genius named Eron Keen (Harrison Gilbertson). Their car crashes and they get mugged. Asha is killed and Grey is paralyzed from the neck down, with only his mother to care for him.Eron visits Grey and offers him the opportunity to regain control of his body, with the help of a neck implant called Stem. The surgery succeeds spectacularly, Grey signs a non-disclosure agreement and heads home, promising that, at least for now, it appears to the world that he's still a quadriplegic. Grey quickly learns that Stem can talk to him (as voiced by Simon Maiden). Given the lack of progress by a police investigator named Cortez (Betty Gabriel), Grey takes advantage of Stem's Alexa-on-steroids capabilities to find the men who killed his wife. Normally not a violent man, Grey finds himself overmatched by these men, who themselves are technologically enhanced, until he learns how Stem can also help him fight. But, alas, avenging his wife's death isn't as satisfying as Grey might've expected.\\\"Upgrade\\\" is a very appropriate title, given some of the writer-director's mediocre movies - and as a comparison to other films in the AI subgenre. This one is a combination of \\\"Deadpool\\\", \\\"Ex Machina\\\", \\\"Transcendence\\\" and the \\\"Bourne\\\" movies, but still feels fresh and creative, visually and narratively. The occasional comedy comes from the combination of Grey adjusting to having Stem's cells in his brain and some gallows humor as he pursues his wife's killers. The film also features one of the best recent casts you never heard of. The high-quality cinematography, editing, acting, pacing, directing and screenplay (with some late-game twists) makes this one of the most balanced and entertaining movies of 2018. \\\"A\\\"\\n\\t13. I guess you can call this a B-movie, but that's not always a bad thing, and certainly not in this case.It has it's moments and some originality, which is rare in todays Hollywood remake factory.As for the B-movie thing it's worth mentioning the actor(s). The main actor had a little... uhm... stiff delivery.It doesn't hurt the movie in any way, it's a nice use of your time, and I will most likely watch it again.\\n\\t14. 'Upgrade' takes up many familiar dystopian sci-fi tropes and fuses them into a generic revenge-action movie. And if you came for the action there is a good change you will like this film. The fighting scenes, involving a combination of (slightly overpowered) superhero physics and grindhouse-like violence, certainly look spectacular, especially considering the low budget. However, if you, like me, came for thought-provoking sci-fi you will probably be disappointed. It's not that it totally lacks great ideas, on the contrary. By touching on too many interesting topics (humanity's increasing dependency on technology, governments and companies experimenting on humans, and, of course, the rise of Artificial Intelligence) you could even argue that the makers bit off more than they could chew. What remains is a cyberpunk action flick that never really goes into depth.The same can also be said of its main characters, all of which seem to lack any emotional complexity. Even the non-enhanced humans in the story often seem to act robotlike. This especially applies to Eron, but also to Grey, who, even though he is supposed to represent humanity in a world dominated by technology, is practically emotionless throughout the entire movie. The underlying problem here seems to be the pace of the film. With a first act taking up no more than ten minutes, the film takes absolutely no time to develop the main characters beyond the archetypes of the \\\"stubborn technophobe\\\", \\\"brilliant but anti-social inventor\\\", and the \\\"happy-go-lucky wife\\\". Not to mention the machine-hybrid cliche supervillain, who is especially hard to take seriously. The limited time you get to spend with these characters makes it even harder to genuinely feel for them as the story unfolds.The film, however, does succeed in bringing to life a dark, grim and empty world that feels painfully familiar and realistic - a sheer contrast with the characters that inhabit it. A scene, for example, that clearly stood out for me was the one with VR-junkies in the worn-out apartment building; it beautifully captured the blurred lines between the \\\"real\\\" and the \\\"fake\\\" that we increasingly seem to experience in everyday life. But even during these rare brilliant moments, the film felt rushed and overshadowed by action sequences. Admittedly, the ending was pretty surprising, but this could hardly compensate for structural flaws of the film. All in all, I found it an unfulfilling experience.\\n\\t15. What an unexpectedly brilliant movie. Lots of laughs, some moments that I almost couldn't look, fabulously different story line, last minute surprise ending, car chases, and brilliant fight scenes.\\n\\t16. I think that many of the reviews below have already summed this movie up quite well. It's a standard revenge movie, but with a sci-fi twist and some incredibly impressive fight scenes. It's well-paced, well-acted, has a solid script, and the plot is more interesting and complicated than you might think from seeing the trailers alone.One other thing I really liked about it was the director's vision of the near future. With a few little exceptions (like how a computer chip in your neck can make you defy physics and stand up without bending any limb) the world here is very believable and depicted in such a way that was visually appealing without going too far as to make it look too flashy to be realistic.Don't let the fact that this was made by someone who directed one of the Insidious movies bother you either. This is wayyyyyy better than any of those movies. Director/writer Leigh Whannell has really found his footing here and delivered a movie that's highly entertaining and doesn't pull any punches.\\n\\t17. Upgrade is a straight-forward, entertaining violent action film about our potential near-future, and it's not all that pretty. This movie is just like a Black Mirror episode, a modernistic yet pessimistic view of how technology is evolving. Some are for it, others are not. The anti-technology theme here is quite clear: Asimov may have been right.First, what did Upgrade do right? Well it's certainly intense, with some really sweet fight scenes and unique choreography. The camera work was fun too. It's an engaging story, good acting, overall a fantastic movie if you love sci-fi and violence.However, there were some issues. For one, the fight scenes were disappointingly few and far in between. I may have been misled by other reviews, but do not go in expecting something like \\\"The Raid\\\" movies. Some plot holes were spotted, and on a personal level, I do not go looking for those while enjoying a movie. Additionally, the plot holes were as obvious as the plot was predictable. So don't expect any ground-breaking story here.But its intentions weren't to grab an Oscar in Best Original Script, or any Oscar for that matter. Its intents were evidently to entertain those who just wanted a great sci-fi action thriller without having to think too much, and to warn us of possible dangers lurking behind the excitement of the modern evolution of technology. So, I guess enjoy the movie, but be cautious of that thing on your kitchen counter that tells you the weather and controls the lights.\\n\\t18. As stories go, Upgrade isn't anything particularly spectacular. There's some really good ideas of course, but the idea of cyborgs and AI taking over humanity are as old as technology itself. It also surprisingly draws parallels to a superhero movie released in the same year; Venom, where a normal Tom Hardy-looking guy finds himself possessed by an entity that helps him get what he wants by controlling his body. Where Upgrade really shines is in its execution. The build-up leading to multiple multi-layered twists upon each other lend the film an unpredictable narrative complexity, where multiple rewatches are guaranteed to illuminate more subtle complexities, callbacks, and foreshadowing.Something that really makes Upgrade stand out is Logan Marshall-Green, who offers a truly impressive physical performance that is both demanding and complicated to achieve. The controlling of his body by an AI leads to some stylish fight choreography, and Marshall-Green doesn't stutter in adding robotic, calculated movements to those scenes, while simultaneously acting in juxtaposition with his head and facial expressions. He's confused and bewildered while he slices a guy up with a kitchen knife, he brags and gloats while his body effortlessly dispatches of goons, he pleads with bad guys not to continue fighting while his robotic-moving arms quickly and decisively disarm and dispatch of them. He holds such an impressive disconnect between his head and his body that I couldn't even imagine how hard it must have been to develop such physical coordination while acting and making it look effortless at the same time. Marshall-Green has never particularly impressed me before, but he has now.Even further though are clever uses of cameras adding another dimension to the film's visual identity. The high points are, again, the fight scenes, where the camera is just as involved in the choreography as the actors and stuntmen are. To add an even greater emphasis on the disconnect between Grey's mind and his body, the camera often keeps him fixed in frame while the settings around him movie. He's just enjoying the ride while his body does the moving, and we're put in that mindset. The way they did it is mount the camera in a rotating frame, hide a phone on Marshall-Green's body, and get them to match orientation. When Marshall-Green moves, the camera moves with him. This becomes especially impressive when Grey ducks and dives, or does full-on back-flips, and the camera mirrors his movements perfectly.Beyond that, the cinematography goes a long way to make this low-budget movie look much more expensive. Lighting is dim and harsh, camera angles are conservative yet stylish, and the CGI is used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary, which has a knock-on effect of grounding an otherwise futuristic world without getting too lofty. The score by Jed Palmer is also fantastic. I was maybe a little disappointed that Whannell didn't go for a Saw-esque climatic track for the third-act revelations, but nonetheless the score is evocative of sci-fi movies of the 70s and 80s, with borderline synthwave tracks interspersed amongst more ambient sounds.Upgrade is a solid sci-fi flick that manages to be refreshing and unique despite its otherwise overdone story elements. It ended up being a better Venom movie than Venom. All it took was an imaginative filmmaker like Leigh Whannell. I honestly can't wait to see what he manages to do next. I give Upgrade a solid 8/10.\\n\\t19. 'Upgrade' is a hybrid action/comedy/horror flick written and directed by Leigh Whannell, who previously brought us the highly successful 'Saw' and 'Insidious' franchises.It stars Logan Marshall-Green, who shall forever be known as Tom Hardy's doppelganger (seriously--compare photos), opposite Betty Gabriel, a rising star famous for her turn in the breakout hit 'Get Out.'While the acting and overall concept are both quite remarkable, there's an unmistakable clunkiness to the film, alternating between the dialogue, blocking, and editing.However, the cinematography is superb, especially on such a low budget, and the action sequences when the bio-mechanical aspect of the film are fully utilized simply aren't to be missed.\\n\\t20. I went into this with fairly low expectations. The trailer looked good, and the cinematography looked exciting. But the premise seemed tired and worn.*in a deep, movie-voice over voice* some guys kill his wife, and now he's seeking revenge\\\".But this film surpassed my expectations, and was a well-worth experience. Not only was I correct about the cinematography being exciting and engaging, but the plot actually strung together compelling way. This film came out of nowhere for me, and now, it's a memorable film that accomplishes the most important goal of any great film: gets the audience to keep wondering about it.Since I don't want to go into spoilers, I'll say one last thing: pay attention to the Foley artist's work. The sound design is poignant and additive to the experience. It reminds me of the clever usage of music from Baby Driver. Nothing is wasted and is always enriching of the world building. With Baby Driver, the music was giving us Baby's personal experience. Here, the sound effects give us Grey's point of view. Didn't experiences, but both are elevated through sound, masterfully.I genuinely want to see it again. If the trailer interested you at all, go see it. It's worth your while.\\n\\t21. Not a lot of buzz was made about this film which kind of landed in theaters with no hype. I saw one trailer at some point and knew I wanted to check it out. Logan Marshall-Green isn't exactly someone who is a leading man. Ryan Atwood's brother and a role in Prometheus are his most notable roles. So it was nice to see him as a lead, and a lesser known cast in this film. Overall, I felt the plot can be tweaked at some points but its a fun film.The film is about a man named Grey, who becomes paraplegic after he and his wife were attacked by a group of hitmen. He is approached by a tech innovator who puts a device in his body which allows him to walk and control his limbs again.. in a way. The device is actually a smart system called STEM and sometimes STEM is allowed to take over, especially when Grey is in danger. Grey uses this newfound ability to track down the men who killed his wife.Insidious: Chapter 3 wasn't overly memorable for me so I feel like this film is where Leigh Whannell puts a stamp on his film making style. The action scenes are excellent when they come. The chase and combat on screen are stellar. The film does well to use its futuristic setting to set a landscape for the film, which itself still feels modern. The film also has humor at the right times. Its not overbearing but when it comes it feels right.My main concerns with the film was the underdeveloped side characters and there's a bit of convenience when need be. The plot feels like it could have been worked in a less cloudy manner but its not a major detraction from the rest of the effort. Its a surprisingly different effort. We've seen this type of film before but the film still seems to remain fresh and fun. Not really a title people are going to talk about this year but its good fun and that's good enough.7/10\\n\\t22. Really enjoyed this movie. A very good dose of future technology and where it would lead us to. We are already seeing the birth of some of the concepts shown in this movie and like with any technology there will be good usage and bad.\\nI dont understand the bad comments on violence as it is \\\"indirect\\\" (without giving away).\\nFast paced and suspenseful. Logan Marshall-Green acted well without any \\\"overacting\\\" or showing off. Screen play and direction were very good. It is original concept and I did not see any connection with Death wish or other movies - not even close or people did not understand the movie?\\n\\t23. Upgrade greatly exceeded my expectations: truly entertaining, and remarkably well produced. Great acting by the lead character. Stylistically speaking, it's perfect: very good cinematography, amazing fight choreography, beautiful scenography and music, perfect CGI, and the overall \\\"feel\\\" of the atmosphere. Only 5 millions were spent. Often, you will not find that attention for scenography and CGI in Hollywood productions.\\nIn the end, it's a little nice movie with a standard plot that nonetheless got me hooked: it got more and more entertaining, and then some more. There are many cliches, but that's a plus: when the director is good, having a cliche smoothly inserted into the story is pure fun. Each of the main events has a reason to be and a nice explanation (sometimes, it's quite original), so that the story never really feels that \\\"standard\\\".\\nThere are just a couple of minor holes here and there, but nothing like what you will read in some reviews: infact, the structure is perfectly logic, and if part of the audience doesn't pay attention, that's not movie's fault.Ps: forgot to mention... I realized I never saw a movie depicting cyber-bio-implants or whatever. Blade Runner does not, Ex-Machina does not, Strange days does not. This movie finally does.\\n\\t24. If you wanted to see \\\"Venom\\\" but didn't want to be distracted by all of the high end special effects and quality acting from Tom Hardy then \\\"Upgrade\\\" is the movie for you\\nLogan Marshall Green puts in a brilliant \\\"I'm not Tom Hardy\\\" performance. His inner dialogue with Kit from \\\"Knight Rider\\\" is beyond reproach.\\nTwo thumbs!\\n\\t25. After ten minutes I came close to switching it off, as I couldn't get into it, it felt as though they were spending too much time showing off future technology, however I stuck with it, and was glad I did, as it develops it really does open up, it became a wonderfully gripping and entertaining sci fi thriller. Very well acted throughout, a pretty original story, and lots of action scenes.The accident really does change the movie up, and the tone, it really is well worth a look, the ending may come as a surprise for some.Very good, 8/10.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Instructions:\\n  1.

Reviews: \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\t1. I love Shakespeare, but I've also always had a soft spot for Ophelia. This reimagining of Hamlet is not faithful to the original text, so have an open mind and you may enjoy it. I don't generally like movies that apply modern sensibilities to classic stories and characters, but this one was tolerable. The acting was fine, the sets and costumes beautiful. Overall it was a fine film. But if you're a purist, don't bother.\\n\\t2. I don't understand why the reviews for this one are so bad. I found this movie quite enjoyable. The acting seemed fine to me and the scenery and costume designs were really lovely. I enjoyed watching this movie a lot. I suppose those looking for the traditional portrayal of Hamlet might be disappointed. I enjoyed the updated dialogue and storyline from Ophelia's point of view. Give it a chance - you'll likely be pleased you did.\\n\\t3. Hard to believe the hostility directed against this movie.\\nIt's not Hamlet, but another take on the story from the viewpoint of Ophelia. The director chose to show the protagonist as a strong women.\\nEnjoyed the character development and the storyline. Directing was solid. All the actors were quite believable in their roles.\\n\\t4. I watched this because I wanted to see what Daisy Ridley's acting was like outside of Star Wars. I had seen her in Murder on the Orient Express, but her role was relatively small in that. This film isn't incredibly exciting, but Ridley certainly gives a fine performance as a fleshed-out Ophelia. The other actors carry themselves well, in addition; and the period sets, costumes, and locations are convincing.\\n\\t5. This was enjoyable in my opinion. I've seen Hamlet. I've read the play. This is not an exact remake of the original work but I liked that it was a reimagining.In this film, Ophelia is our main character and we seen how things unfold from her perspective. Her role in the original work is a big deal seeing as she was the innocence in a corrupt court who was driven to insanity and then suicide after the deaths of the men she loved most. Suicide was her escape from all the revenge, evil and madness taking place around her. Here we see her much more resilient without losing her innocent nature. The basic plot of the film is still present but things don't go down the same way.I thought it was filmed well and the acting was good. I thought the concept presented was creative. I'm sure that a lot of folks will take issue and feel like it was to far removed from the original work but if you take it for what it is rather than point out all the differences, it was a good film. I say check it out.\\n\\t6. It is not surprising the name of the costume designer features so early in the credits because he played a major role in making this film so watchable. All those gorgeous costumes must have cost a bit but along with some splendid d\\u00e9cor, ecclesiastical and baronial interiors (and a few exteriors) and outdoor scenes of woods glades and hills this film never fail to offer pleasure for the eye. The story proceeds at a sufficient pace with some unexpected twists and turns while bringing out how empty and unsatisfying royal or any great power can be. Is it really worth fighting so hard for? Pity about the mayhem of the penultimate scene, it was unnecessary, but makes Ophelia's choice at the end seem a wise one.\\n\\t7. Critics seem to have difficulties agreeing on whether this is a spin-of of Hamlet to tell Ophelia's story, or simply Hamlet's story told from Ophelia's POV. I tend to side with the former.\\nOne thing definitely reimagined here is that Ophelia is no longer a helpless, passive victim eventually driven to madness. She is all courage, intelligence, wit, spirit, resourceful, and more. And why not, if she is played by Daisy Ridley whom we know best as Rey, the new heroine in the third and final trilogy of the Star Wars saga that spanned the silver screen for over 4 decades. Incidentally, in about 2 months, our patience will be rewarded with the answer to Rey's real heritage. But I digress.\\nAmong other things, this movie has a generous offer of witty word plays. Right at the start, when Ophelia as a child (Mia Quiney) is taken under the wings of Queen Gertrude (Naomi Watts), the first exchange includes the Queen's mild exclamation of \\\"Alas, indeed\\\", which is turned by the witty Ophelia into \\\"a lass\\\", as she is often mistaken for a boy in her tomboyish childhood.\\nIn the first encounter (not counting stealing glances at each other at a distance) between Ophelia and Hamlet (George MacKay), she is fully submerged in serene lake water when surprised by him and Horatio on shore. Hamlet promptly commented that as she is a lady-in-waiting, perhaps she wouldn't mind waiting a bit longer. They would not inconvenience themselves on her account with looking for another spot for fishing. Totally unruffled, Ophelia teasingly emerges from water in tantalizingly slow motion, only to have the jaw-dropping Hamlet finally discover that she is fully clothed (Horatio has already walked away in embarrassment). That is a most definitive establishing scene of Ophelia.\\nOther depiction of Ophelia includes \\\"she dances like a goat\\\" (as per the other ladies-in-waiting). B then, she is \\\"a girl that can read\\\", surprising Gertrude who immediately gets even as Ophelia finds that her bedside reading to the queen is not a book of religious devotion but passionate novels of romance.\\nIn this movie, the Shakespearean English has been modernized, exemplified in probably the best-known fatherly advice, \\\"Neither a borrower nor a lender be\\\". Here, what Polonius says to Laertes becomes \\\"Do not borrow any money or lend it\\\". Incidentally if you find the face of the actor who plays Ophelia's brother Laertes familiar, you should. This is none other than Tom Felton, otherwise better known as Draco Malfoy in Harry-Potter-verse. But I digress again.\\nFor the top-tier star presence, in addition to Ridley and Watts, there is also Clive Owen who plays the usurping uncle Claudius, most likely with more malice than you have seen anywhere else before. Note also that Watts plays not just one character, but two! Entirely new to the plot is Mechtild, a mysterious witch from whom Gertrude obtains potions for preservation of youthful looks. She also carries a secret that affects the big picture but let me not spoil it. Similarly, I will not spoil the plot which initially follows the Bard's but later throws in some twists.\\nAs mentioned in my \\\"headline\\\", this movie has aa art-house feel, but is not get overboard. The pace, for one thing, is brisk. The cinematography is first-rate, as well as costume design. There is much to enjoy, if this is your cup of tea.\\n\\t8. I didn't know what to expect but I thought it was a pretty cool movie. I don't know much about Hamlet but I was entertained. Bravo.\\n\\t9. I read the book by Lisa Klein that this is based on as a teenager. I loved it, so I might be a bit biased, but I didn't mind the changes to the Hamlet story. I thought the costumes, sets, and everything where gorgeous. The casting is good and most of the actors do the best they can with weakly written dialogue. My other TINY complaint is that they changed the ending from the book where she ends up with Horatio.Also, ignore the people who complain about having actors of different races in a medieval story. It's the 21st century. I think it's okay to cast the actor who is best for the role without getting hung up on race.\\n\\t10. \\\"Ophelia\\\" is a Drama - Romance movie in which we watch Hamlet from Ophelia's perspective. She was raised by Queen Gertrude in Elsinore Castle and she had some feelings for Prince Hamlet. Passion, romance, vengeance combined in this movie.I found this movie interesting and different since it's from a different perspective than usual. The direction which was made by Claire McCarthy was good and she presented well her main characters and the plot behind her movie. The interpretation of Daisy Ridley who played as Ophelia was good and her combination with some other actors/actresses created a good result. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Naomi Watts's who played as Gertrude / Mechtild, Clive Owen's who played as Claudius and George MacKay's who played as Hamlet. Finally, I have to say that \\\"Ophelia\\\" is an interesting movie and I recommend you to watch it just from curiosity.\\n\\t11. Never mind all the fake early ten-star reviews here--if you can't tell they're fake from the writing, click on the person's handle and you'll see that inevitably they have never posted about another movie before.This movie gets five stars for being well-produced, good-looking, professionally acted and crafted. I can't argue that it would probably entertain less discriminating (and younger) audiences, esp. if they have no prior experience with \\\"Hamlet.\\\" (God help the high school student who one day is going to figure they can skip reading the play and do a book report just from seeing this film.) But if you ARE at all familiar with \\\"Hamlet,\\\" this is is pretty ludicrous. It's not that it departs from the play in many ways; \\\"Hamlet\\\" is such a ubiquitous classic that it can certainly withstand and even welcome some imaginative, revisionist takes.(partial spoilers ahead] The probolem is that this particular take is that of a stereotypical current teenage romance-novel-slash-fantasy a la \\\"Twilight\\\" and \\\"Wicked.\\\" Poor Ophelia must of course be a spunky little rebel who only PRETENDS to go mad, won't let men tell her what to do, and other things that seem more than a bit preposterous for a young lady in a medieval Danish court. Of course Hamlet is ALL about her, in a brooding, lovesick, tormented Robert Pattinson-in-\\\"Twilight\\\" way. Things are manipulated so crazily to make O. the center of this whole story that she even sees the Ghost of Hamlet's father before he does! Because she is just that special.Gertrude is made to be bitchy and insecure, reducing Naomi Watts' performance; Clive Owen is solid as Claudius, and other performances are OK. But it's distracting that another concession to young audiences is making the court multi-ethnic, as if there were many black people around in 11th-century Denmark or whenever this is supposed to be. It's not that this is quasi-modernized, which needn't be a bad thing; it's that it's done in such a stereotypical, shallow, trendy fashion that the effect is ultimately kinda laughable.You can't say this is really a \\\"feminist\\\" take, because it's too juvenile in its approach--Ophelia may be somewhat \\\"empowered,\\\" but she's also the girl whom the Prince himself offers to \\\"walk away from it all\\\" for! She's supposed to be \\\"tough,\\\" in a sort of Katniss-in-\\\"Hunger Games\\\" way, but she also gets to be Cinderella, too. If you're getting the feeling from my description that this movie piles up way too many cliches in order to hit the target audience bull's-eye, you'd be exactly right. But jiudging from the film's reception so far, obviously you can OVERESTIMATE what your audience presumably wants, and give them so much of it that they feel condescended to. This expensive-looking movie is pretty much going straight to VOD, and that is because it is more 21st-century \\\"Gidget\\\" than \\\"Hamlet.\\\" Doing the story from Ophelia's point of view was a good idea--and someday, someone may do it right.\\n\\t12. As a huge fan of Shakespeare, I truly enjoyed this alternate take on the tale of Hamlet and Ophelia. The star-studded cast was a delight to watch deliver superb performances. The sets were absolutely breathtaking and the costuming was tasteful and evocative. The film was a rich feast of color and the music touched my heart. I found myself singing along with the theme and humming it after the end of the movie. I just love that a woman wrote the book, another the screenplay and the director was female as well. This definitely is a step in the right direction of telling \\\"herstory\\\" to take its rightful place aside \\\"history\\\".\\n\\t13. People are very harsh. Okay it's not Shakespeare- no pun intended- it's still pretty fun if not heavy on the PC stuff. Naomi Watts in two roles is always dependable. Clive Owens is a bit scary, the wig ... worth a watch if you're fan fiction kinda person.\\n\\t14. Characters act like it's happening in 21st century: winking, rolling eyes at each other, etc. Ruins the authenticity of the period of time its based in.\\n\\t15. I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. It seems to have polarized movie-goers, many \\\"1\\\" votes and many \\\"10\\\" votes. I quite like it, the movie has an interesting story and is acted and filmed very well.I have the advantage of not knowing very much at all about Shakespeare's \\\"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\\\" , the source play for the book and now the movie. As the filmmakers explain, this is a re-imagining of the basic story with more focus on Ophelia and Queen Gertrude, and what the complexity of their characters might have been. Die-hard Shakespeare fans most likely take issue, anything that changes from his various versions would likely be considered unforgivable sins.But taken as a story greatly \\\"inspired\\\" by the play, with some significant changes and trajectory for Ophelia, it works very well, at least it does for me. Not a great movie but certainly very watchable and suitably entertaining. Not a \\\"10\\\", not a \\\"1\\\", somewhere between those extremes.Daisy Ridley is really good as Ophelia, playing her as a reasonable but strong person. I don't really know much of his work but George MacKay (mac-eye) works well as Hamlet and Naomi Watts as Gertrude.\\n\\t16. There are so many expeditions into the forest and a cave that are made by Ophelia in this film that it is easy to confuse \\\"Ophelia\\\" with \\\"Dora and the Lost City of Gold\\\"!Tom Stoppard's \\\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\\\" was a play and later a film that showed Shakespeare's \\\"Hamlet\\\" from the perspectives of two schlubs who are given their fifteen minutes of fame. By contrast, \\\"Ophelia\\\" deconstructs Shakespeare's narrative not only to unfold the action from Ophelia's point of view, but it also completely reinvents the character and the narrative.In the bonus track of the DVD of \\\"Ophelia,\\\" one of the film's producers described their Ophelia as a \\\"spitfire,\\\" and within the film itself, she describes herself to us as \\\"willful.\\\" The director, Claire McCarthy, noted a \\\"tongue-in-cheek\\\" stylistic approach to the Shakespearean classic in the way that characters and events are entirely changed.Some of the most outrageous choices were have Ophelia marry Hamlet! The ceremony takes place in the forest in the style of Friar Lawrence overseeing the ceremony of Romeo and Juliet tying the knot. The quick-thinking Ophelia is also making rounds on the ramparts of Elsinore late at night on the lookout for the Ghost. Ophelia and Hamlet are both aware of that eavesdropping is occurring in a crucial scene, so they begin to whisper to each other as Claudius and Polonius are listening in. This Ophelia also does not go mad, but rather feigns the madness, giving an award-winning performance of the staged mad songs in front of the court. But the most radical change is that Ophelia stages her own death, giving the impression that she has drowned in the river!The filmmakers clearly wanted to avoid any semblance of Ophelia as a victim. In the bonus track of the DVD, McCarthy reiterated how this Ophelia was to have \\\"agency\\\" in her life. She begins as a commoner, then rises to the level of handmaiden to Queen Gertrude, prior to marrying the Prince of Denmark, and ultimately living to become a widow and proud single mom!The film was directed by a woman, and the screenplay was written by a woman, based on a woman's novel. The featured characters, Ophelia and Gertrude, were woman, and a new female character of the \\\"healer\\\" named Mechtild, is Gertrude's sister, who is always available to provide poisons, potions, and cure-alls in her cave.To crown it off, there is the convent of St. Emilion, where women who are harassed at the court may flee to safety. The protagonist will in time avail herself of the sanctuary afforded by St. Emilion. So, when Hamlet tells Ophelia, \\\"Get thee to a nunnery,\\\" he is providing the most important advice that will help to ensure victory for our Super Heroine, turning her into an Ophelia for our time!!\\n\\t17. Based on the novel by Lisa Klein, the film follows the story of Hamlet from Ophelia's perspective. The movie boasts of a talented cast, tells the story on a different and interesting point of view and has a great ending. Unfortunately it suffers from some script's problems and sometimes it isn't as gripping as it should have been.Rating: 6,5.\\n\\t18.

I just watched this for entertainment, I'm not a Shakespeare purist. Entertaining, engaging enough to hold my interest, with an interesting plot.\\n\\t20. I really don't understand why there are so many really negative reviews and positive reviews being downvoted. Is it Daisy? Is it that someone's approached Shakespeare from a new angle?I'll never find out the answer but it's a real shame.I really loved this movie. I wasn't sure on Daisy in this kind of role having only seen her in Star Wars before but I actually think she played it beautifully. I have seen someone else say they think this would have been a Kiera Knightley role ten years ago and I agree, but she would have ruined it. It needed to be understated. It needed to be timid as well as strong. None of that makes sense I suppose but in my head it does.I'm not a fan of Naomi Watts or Clive Owen but they were watchable and actually I cried for Naomi's Gertrude at the end.The costumes are gorgeous, the scenery and settings beautiful and the soundtrack is wonderful, especially the music playing over the ending scenes.It made me interested in Hamlet again.\\n\\t21. As a person who never read Shakespeares' work and is not familiar with this story, I think this movie was just okay.Pros - the production design and cinematography is kinda cool. There are some really cool shots throughout the movie & dresses, the location, they felt real.Daisy Ridley was pretty good as Ophelia, it was kinda nice to see her in something other than Star Wars.The film is overall not that bad and watchable at times, but a lot of the time I couldn't help but think it was just mid.The characters in this movie are very flat. Even though some actors tries their best and you can kinda see it, but the script doesn't explore or develop these characters that much. They didn't feel interesting other than Ophelia. (Even her character isn't that 'great', either)The film isn't a disaster but I think it could have been a LOT better.Edit: Daisy Ridley actions mad scene>>\\n\\t22. Pointless, boring, uninspired, insipid waste of time\\nalso - lol at there being Black and Asian people in the medieval Danish court\\n\\t23. I was afraid to watch this due to the fact that I have never read or seen Hamlet or anything related, and the poor reviews.\\nBut one Saturday afternoon, on a cloudy day, just finishing opening up a hot skull of a woman having increased intracranial pressure, the wife and decided, what the heck.\\nAnd so, I immensely enjoyed it. Story was engaging, Daisy as cute as ever. The banter not too dragging. No need for expositions. Naration was just enough.\\nGood movie. Watch it yourself for what it is, not what it is supposed to be (I guess).\\n\\t24. Having not read Hamlet, and being a fan of the woman's point of view, I found the actors, sceneries and story to do a great job of holding my attention. Many reviews of those who have seen Hamlet are low, but this film has now led me to begin reading Hamlet, which might change how I rate this film, but as of now, I would recommend.\\n\\t25. I'm an ultra-lefty feminist and even I eyerolled. Why couldn't it be a genuine dramatic tragedy. It didn't need this type of girl power remake.

So far I have loved every role I have seen Chadwick Boseman play, he is a great actor and has this sort of swagger when acting. Sterling K Brown is great and one of the greatest actors in recent years. It was different but enjoyable seeing Josh Gad in a drama. I wish they would make more of these movies that follow Thurgood Marshall's journey. The only negative thing is that it felt a bit long.\\n\\t2. Greetings again from the darkness. The question must be asked: is the movie worthy of the man? The man was the first attorney for the NAACP. He won 29 of the 32 cases he argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, including the ground-breaking 1954 Brown v. Board of Education (separate but equal public education). This man was a trailblazer for Civil Rights, and in 1967 became the first African- American Supreme Court Justice. This man was, of course, Thurgood Marshall \\u0085 a man who unquestionably deserves not just a movie, but a really good and important one.Chadwick Boseman has taken on film versions of such icons as Jackie Robinson in 42 and James Brown in GET ON UP, so he likely jumped at the chance to play the revered figure, Thurgood Marshall. Mr. Boseman has true movie star screen presence, and supplies the young Mr. Marshall with a self-assured swagger that accompanies a brilliant legal mind \\u2013 a mind that refused to be ignored during a time it was desperately needed. Lest he be labeled a superhero, the film does portray Marshall smoking and drinking, while also hinting at his carousing. The common flaws of a great man.It's 1941 and the young (33 years old) Marshall is the lone NAACP attorney, so he spends his time ping-ponging around the country fighting for fair trials for those African-Americans accused simply because they aren't white. He works only for \\\"innocent\\\" people and his efforts during this time were crucial to the Civil Rights movement gaining attention and legitimacy. Most of the film centers on a case in Connecticut (no, not the Jim Crow south) where a black man, Joseph Spell (Sterling K Brown), is accused of sexual assault of a \\\"respectable\\\" married white woman, Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson). If you are reminded of the great book and film TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, you must know that those literary and cinematic standards are such that few can ever hope to reach.What follows is not one of the more dramatic or tension-filled cinematic courtroom dramas. There is simply too much levity for the film to be classified as a historical heavyweight. That said, the man and his story are fascinating, and though director Reginald Hudlin chooses a deft touch rather than a sledge hammer, it's likely the wise choice if the goal is to entertain, while also educating the masses to Marshall's early career. Josh Gad co-stars as Marshall's co-counsel Sam Friedman, a specialist in legal technicalities within the insurance industry. Boseman and Gad have nice chemistry (at times it feels like a buddy movie), and as a Jew in those times, Friedman is himself stuck in limbo between staunch racism and acceptance by the white community.James Cromwell plays Judge Foster, yet another man caught between the old world he has lived in his entire life and the fast-changing society and legal system that permits him to silence Marshall, while also forcing (somewhat) fair treatment of the accused Spell. Dan Stevens (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST) is Loren Willis, the disgusted and disgusting prosecutor. This character is so cartoonish that the only thing missing is a neon necklace that flashes \\\"racist\\\" as he speaks. Sophia Bush has a brief, yet important scene and Sterling K Brown (as Mr. Spell) has the film's most heart-breaking moment as he sits on the stand and explains why he lied.Director Reginald Hudlin seems like an odd choice for the project. He has been working mostly in TV since back-to-back-to-back bombs BOOMERANG (Eddie Murphy), THE LADIES MAN (Tim Meadow) and SERVING SARA (Matthew Perry). Mr. Hudlin has experienced more success as a Producer, having been Oscar nominated for DJANGO UNCHAINED. Here he works with the father and son screenwriters Jacob Koskoff and Michael Koskoff. The elder Michael is a well respected criminal attorney and legal historian, and certainly understands the expectations that come with offering a public look at a near- mythical figure \\u0085 especially one as revered as Thurgood Marshall.This isn't so much a movie about the icon as it is about a young man on the path to greatness and importance (he served on the Supreme Court from 1967-1991). The soundtrack is filled with jazz which complements the light-hearted approach, and further distances from any semblance of \\\"heavy\\\" or \\\"historical\\\". Director Hudlin adds a contemporary touch by having Trayvon Martin's parents (Sybrina Fulton, Tracy Martin) appear in a scene near the end. On the downside, multiple upshot camera angles are designed to make his lead character look larger than life. The truth is, Thurgood Marshall required no help in looming large. Hopefully this mainstream approach pays off and many are introduced to the legacy of a man who is more than worthy of this movie \\u0085 and another.\\n\\t3. I got to attend an early screening of Marshall tonight. I'm interested to see how critics react. I have a feeling many of them will object to the \\\"paint-by-numbers\\\" approach to the film. While we have not seen Thurgood Marshall represented much in film, it does feel like we've seen this movie more than once before. But that isn't really the point. I've eaten spaghetti and meatballs hundreds of times before. I still enjoy it each time, the same dish, so long as it is made well. And Marshall, while not reinventing any wheels, is made well. Chadwick Boseman leads a terrific cast that includes Josh Gad, Dan Stevens, James Cromwell, Kate Hudson and Sterling K. Brown. Everyone is there to give this very important true story some depth and weight. At the same time, the screenplay never gets too caught up in its own self-importance. While some very dark themes and tragic events are present, there is a sense of humor pervading much of the film. This makes the people and events portrayed in Marshall relatable, instead of feeling like we're watching a group of untouchable, stoic historical figures. Marshall isn't designed to inspire anger or guilt, instead it encourages us to examine examples of unity that have been used to overcome struggle. It has more in common with films like The Help or Hidden Figures, than more aggressive films like Detroit (though that film is very intense and impressive). I would say Marshall will play out just as well at home as it does in a theater, but there is something about seeing it with a crowd that in this case adds to the experience. The gasps of the audience when an atrocity is displayed, the clapping when a bigot loses his/her battle-it is a good film to enjoy with an audience. From a technical standpoint, the film does not go out of its way to impress. The cinematography, costume and production design, music, editing-all seems serviceable if not particularly memorable. In this case its the story and the figures it portrays that you'll remember. 7/10.\\n\\t4. Growing up one of the first influential black figures I learned about was Supreme Court Judge Thurgood Marshall. While my life didn't veer in the path he took, it was a chance for me as a young black male to see the dedication and time he took to his craft and where it could take you. Almost 2 decades have passed since then, and found myself surprised to see a film finally based on him and his capabilities. While the younger me was excited, I found myself wondering how this film would hold up side by side with other black period films like itself in recent history.Thurgood (Chadwick Boseman) is working in the NAACP when he is tapped for a court case of the accusation of a black male rumored to have raped a woman and thrown her off into the river and left for dead. While he travels to Connecticut for the trial, he finds himself hard pressed given he is a out of town lawyer unfamiliar to the client, and is left to have a inexperienced attorney (Josh Gad) to speak on his behalf in court. While Thurgood knows most of the material and how to move in court, he has to show Josh's character the way to observe things his way.The performances are all relatively solid by no surprise given the cast. Josh Gad is able to sell the inexperienced character almost having to be hand held through every decision made in the courtroom. Also the development of him progressively becoming more confident as time goes forward. The writing in the courtroom is interesting enough to keep you invested in knowing what's the truth and the holes in one plaintiff and defendants stories.Alas, my biggest issue with the film is really the lasting impact. While it is perfectly watchable in the moment, I felt as if a story like this should have had more lasting impact than what I saw given it's a film in a movie theater. It's not as riddled with clich\\u00e9s like preceding films I've seen in the past, but misses a strong distinctive voice. For some the issues I had with Hidden Figures, I at least know who the target audience was for the film and what they wanted to take from the movie. Marshall doesn't really have that same feeling. The writing is never bad, but never as sharp as it feels like it should be until the second half when more gets revealed.Marshall in a nutshell I would say is \\\"almost there\\\" as a movie. Fine within the moment but leaves a bit desired when the credits rolled. I wouldn't turn anyone away from seeing this, but may be best suited seen at home.\\n\\t5. This enjoyable and inspiring movie is a worthy contribution to the courtroom movie genre. It memorializes the great Thurgood Marshall (who later won Brown v. Bd. of Education and sat on the Supreme Court). The film brings to life a forgotten rape case in Connecticut that Marshall tried early in his career when he was the solo staff lawyer at the NAACP. The story focuses on the plight of a black man accused of raping a white woman and it highlights issues of racism in the courtroom and on the streets. The movie recalls the classic fllms \\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\\" (which also involved a black on white rape case) and \\\"Anatomy of a Murder\\\" (which also involved sexual issues and in which--like many real trials--we're never sure just what actually happened and who is telling the truth). The writing is sharp and witty and the acting and direction are great. Particularly strong is the emerging partnership and friendship of Marshall and the local lawyer, Sam Friedman, who had never tried a criminal case and thought he would just sit next to Marshall during the trial and and do nothing. But the judge forces Friedman to conduct the trial with Marshall serving as his adviser--and he rises to the occasion.\\n\\t6. Whether it's the Godfather of Soul, the first black baseball player, or the first black superhero, it's fair to say Chadwick Boseman is becoming one of the best actors of his generation.So there was high hopes for this bio-pic about NAACP Civil Rights lawyer and first black supreme court justice Thurgood Marshall.The film looks at one of the first cases of his career; a black chauffeur accused of rape by his white employer in Connecticut. Josh Gad is also in the film as a Jewish lawyer roped into being lead on the case when a judge decrees Marshall can only assist. This is important as the Gadd character has never tried a criminal case before.You keep expecting Boseman to get that nomination sooner or later, \\\"Get on Up\\\" should have been his ticket, but \\\"Marshall\\\" while pretty good in most areas, just doesn't feel like it has enough weight to it.I wish they did go with a bigger case of his, or just go all out and go with the one he's known most for- Brown v. Board of Education.The movie becomes another case of a black man being railroaded by a biased and corrupt system built on fabrications. For some that may be enough to hold them; the court room scenes that take up most of the movie are often rousing if not predictable.This is all pretty easy-going though- by the second half it's pretty much a comedy the lengths most of the white people in this movie will go to to hide their prejudices.At times it almost feels like their trying to start a Thurgood Marshall movie Universe here- like this one may not be that good but we'll tease you with some of the better stuff to come if you want it.But even so, Boseman brings life to this character, whether it's Marshall's perceptiveness or his gift of gab, he's cool because he knows he's the smartest guy in the room at any given time.Josh Gad has his moments but he still can't seem to fully get out of the goofy sidekick role. We'll have to see how he does in \\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\\".Oddly enough this is a bio-pic that comes across more as a crowd-pleasing good time than something that's going to be remembered at the end of the year, which is fine.I laughed, I was invested in the court trial mostly, the performances, including from Sterling K. Brown as the chauffeur are very good. Yet you just feel like it should have done more.So the score is 7 out of 10.

First there was James Brown the Godfather of Soul, then it was Jackie Robinson the first black player in modern times in major league baseball. Now it is Thurgood Marshall, but Marshall in his early days as a lawyer for the National Association For The Advancement Of Colored People.Thurgood Marshall in his career litigated many major civil rights cases including the most famous of all Brown vs. Board Of Education in 1954 that integrated the school system nationwide. Later on his career was capped by becoming the first black justice on the Supreme Court.This story takes place in the late 30s by the music and the radio broadcasts with the news of the day. Thurgood Marshall has been sent to Connecticut to defend Sterling K. Brown a black chauffeur on a charge of raping his employer Kate Hudson.This may be the north, but the racial attitudes in Greenwich, Connecticut are only more subdued than they are in Alabama. Fairfield County in those days in the richer suburban towns are pretty bad. You remember from Auntie Mame the phrase, Aryan from Darien. They're not crazy about Jews either.Marshall being an outsider to the state has to be admitted to the Connecticut bar. Local attorney Sam Friedman played by Josh Gad is the lead counsel temporarily and the first motion is to get Marshall admitted. That is usually a pro forma thing, note how Matt Damon has to be admitted to the bar in Tennessee in The Rainmaker.Such courtesy is denied Marshall by Judge James Cromwell. But he's allowed to sit at the defense table and coach Friedman. Despite a few curves thrown at the defense Gad who only did civil cases before this for insurance companies proves to be a pretty good advocate.Boseman steps up to his role just as he did with Jackie Robinson and James Brown. He also has some wonderful domestic scenes with his wife Keesha Sharp and at a nightclub with Jussie Smollett and Chilli Thomas as Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. Good performances you think these are the real people.Thurgood Marshall was also portrayed on screen by Sidney Poitier in the film Separate But Equal dealing with the school integration cases right up to the Supreme Court. These two really ought to be seen back to back for a full assessment of Marshall's career.In his time when Lyndon Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court it wasn't just race that made Marshall's appointment unique. It was the whole level of experience in the kind of law he practiced for people like Sterling K. Brown. The goal is justice and the law has to work for all for justice to be realized.Marshall is a film not to be missed.\\n\\t8. Thurgood Marshall was a legendary lawyer who became the first black judge in the US Supreme Court.Their is a good film to be made about his life, this is not it.Marshall focuses in one attempted murder case that he was involved in back in 1941 when he was a lawyer for the NAACP.It really is a modern version of To Kill a Mockingbird. A black man Joseph Spell is accused of raping a respectable married white woman who employed him. Spell then threw her off a bridge and left her to die.Marshall comes to Connecticut and teams up with a reluctant Jewish insurance lawyer Sam Friedman because the judge would not allow Marshall to be lead counsel.It is an effective courtroom drama, especially as Friedman is an inexperienced criminal lawyer who slowly discovers that there is more to law than insurance litigation.Chadwick Boseman shines as Marshall but there is nothing groundbreaking here as Marshall leads Friedman into the nuances of criminal litigation.\\n\\t9. Marshall is a sleek legal drama with great performances from Chadwick Boseman as the title character and Josh Gad. Don't be fooled by the snazzy vintage costumes, the real heart of Marshall's success is its screenplay and the chemistry between its lead actors.This film follows pioneering Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in his earlier years as a lawyer for the NAACP. A white socialite in Greenwich, Connecticut, accuses a black man of rape and attempted murder. The NAACP believes the man, Joseph Spell, is innocent and sends Marshall to defend him. Marshall enlists local lawyer Sam Friedman (Josh Gad) whose previous track record involves tax or insurance cases. Friedman worries about his family's safety due to the unrest the controversial trial causes. Sam and Thurgood must work together to defend Spell\\u0085and each other.This film is very good and so is its screenplay. The touches of comedy bring a welcome balance to its serious topic and difficult history. There is an array of good lines for Boseman and Gad. Several other actors get a chance to shine as well. I appreciate that Marshall takes its subjects seriously, but doesn't take on a dreary tone doing it. The scenes in the courtroom are intense and keep you interested in the action. As the case develops, these scenes get more and more engaging.While Boseman is very good as Thurgood Marshall, his performance is disappointing considering how hyped his portrayal has been in the film's ad campaign. He gives Marshall a suave personality but the script limits his ability to show off his range and really take the character on a journey. On the other hand, Josh Gad is a standout as Sam Friedman. He plays to his comedic strengths as Marshall's sidekick while also giving a genuinely good dramatic performance as a central and evolved character. He is a nice foil to Boseman and their chemistry reminds me of a buddy cop comedy.The lesson I take from the film is that you have to follow your moral compass even when it's hard. Sam's unwillingness to join the case makes sense. He is just starting out and worried that it could ruin his reputation. The fact that he does it anyway is a testament to the person Friedman must have been in real life.I give Marshall an age rating of 14 to 18 because of some racial and offensive language and suggestive and violent content, including depictions of the alleged assault. And my verdict on Marshall? 4 out of 5 stars. Marshall opens in theaters on October 13, 2017 so go check it out.Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.\\n\\t10. An exceptional story with great achievements and with great potential that delivers short in the movie, it could be a heartbreaking drama it could be an outstanding acting film but the played it safe, the cast, the screenplay, the pace, the script was just enough to make it work, yes the film is enjoyable, but without risks, just a great story captured in a regular but enjoyable movie.\\n\\t11. A powerful, engaging, sleek legal drama based on the facts .. a true story.. About one of the pioneer NAACP lawyer and his role during racial tensions .. how Thurgood Marshall was there \\\"not to extinguish fire but to be one\\\" in his words.. commendable performances by the protagonists Chadwick Boseman and Josh Gad.. a must see\\n\\t12. You would think it would be straight forward to come up with a provocative movie set in the US when segregation was in vogue. Not so! Roger Friedman is a decendant of Sam Friedman and a film critic who wrote an interesting article criticising the many inaccuracies in this film.So, the director and writers have an easy topic to critique history. They had a great man like Thurgood Marshall and some backward social attitudes that are as backward as our attitudes toward domestic violence today. Instead, the authors fill the movie with false facts and make Marshall look like an arrogant, unrefined twit (which he was neither). The directors and writers play the race card in all the wrong ways* and throw in a few sex jibes to top off a good dose of revisionism, undermining what could have been a great movie.As others have said, Josh Gad was the better principal actor in this movie. Sterling Brown as the accused was far more nuanced and capable than Chadwick Boseman as Marshall. Boseman is charming, but a totally wrong fit.I still give it a 6/10, which is very generous given the director and writers who totally failed to capture the essence of the story. The revisionist history and significant number of factual errors cast a large shadow over what could have been a great movie.Is the truth not interesting enough? The real Marshall is an amazing man - far better than Boseman's insulting copy.* Hollywood needs to curb its political correctness. I've banned my children from watching new movies until I screen them. That's how bad Hollywood has become. I know quite a few parents who feel the same way.\\n\\t13. I was hoping it would be a movie about the life of Thurgood Marshall. Instead it was focused on one case and didn't give much insight into Marshall at all. It was a decent movie, but with the life Marshall led, this can't have been even close to the most interesting story they could have told.\\n\\t14. It's 1941. Thurgood Marshall (Chadwick Boseman) travels the country as NAACP's only lawyer crusading for black defendants against the racist justice system. His next case is in Greenwich, Connecticut where rich housewife Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson) has accused her driver Joseph Spell (Sterling K. Brown) of raping her. Insurance lawyer Sam Friedman (Josh Gad) is recruited. He's reluctant and on top of that, Judge Foster (James Cromwell) refuses to accept Marshall into the local state bar. With Marshall silenced in court and with no criminal court experience, Friedman has to battle entitled prosecutor Loren Willis (Dan Stevens).This is a biodrama of one particular case with future Supreme Court judge Marshall. The story is compelling and the history is fascinating. The actors are all first rate. The actual court case does have some awkward turns. It's a thin line between blaming the victim and searching for the truth. It may help to definitively declare Spell as innocent from the start. This shouldn't be a courtroom mystery and should skew more towards underdog courtroom drama. If Marshall gets the truth from Spell at the beginning, he would come out looking even better. There are a lot of twisting that reminds me too much of a TV courtroom drama. I do love a lot of this movie but little things keep bugging me. For example, I love the kitchen knife joke but their kiss after temple strikes me as too much. I prefer a knowing touch and a sweet smile for her husband to drive home that scene much better. None of the little issues prevent me from really enjoying this well-acted compelling historical drama.\\n\\t15. I hate to say most, but there's a lot of biopics that are very formulaic in nature. And come to think of it, every genre deals with that issue. I can acknowledge that it's immensely hard to make a film that feels fresh and relevant at the same time. But I think the reason I tend to feel this way about biopics is because a lot of them seem to be directly aimed for the Oscar audience. And while that could be the case with Marshall, it's nothing less than a delightful film to watch.As with so many biopics, the main reason Marshall succeeds is Chadwick Boseman's unsurprisingly good turn as the famous lawyer, Thurgood Marshall. Whether or not Thurgood was this way in real life, I absolutely loved the sheer display of confidence in Boseman's portrayal. It was almost to the point of cockiness, without being arrogant. It's that balance that made me appreciate what this man brought to the table.Of course, there's also the dynamic of having a story that is still relevant to this day. Not only are people of color still discriminated, underestimated, and not believed in the court of law, but the idea of pitting race against race in the courtroom is something that is still unfortunately an issue today. So in a way, it was disheartening to watch the injustices happening throughout Marshall, as we know they are far from being over in the 1940's, but it's always nice to see something stick up for their people no matter what time period they are from.Boseman isn't the only one who gives a good performance as Josh Gad, Sterling K. Brown, Kate Hudson, James Cromwell, and a few others give valuable turns as their respected characters. I think my only issue with the film is that it ultimately felt very safe. I'm not one to know how these real life cases played out, but Marshall definitely feels like it took a guarded approach to the subject matter. Because of that, you can appeal to a mass audience, but I don't know that it was as detailed or thorough that it needed to be. Don't get me wrong, Marshall is a powerful film, but I think it could have taken an even further step forward into that realm.8.2/10\\n\\t16. Marshall\\nDirected by Reginald Hudlin. Written by Michael Koskoff and Jacob KoskoffI watch a variety of films. I like horror and thrillers but at the same time can enjoy a historical drama as well. This movie falls into that category. Marshall stars Chadwick Boseman(Black Panther) as Thurgood Marshall as he travels to Bridgeport, Connecticut to help a black man accused of raping a well to do woman. He is not allowed to participate in the court proceedings so his proxy is Josh Gad who is not a criminal defense attorney. This is all based on a true story. So it has that going for it.This is a perfect example of a fine movie. A fine movie is enjoyable. A fine movie has quality performances throughout. A fine movie tells a story that you can follow and you might even be invested in but a fine movie doesn't do more than that. This is an important story. It tells how Marshall has this last trial to get the NAACP going in respect to civil rights progress.It does all of this just fine. It just never engages more than that. It hits all the spots that it is supposed to hit when it comes to this kind of story. I hate trying to talk about movies like this. There is little to say because the movie tells it's courtroom drama adequately enough. It doesn't present with too much visual flair because the story is the most important aspect. I think it could have done with some melodramatics and some out there visual flair. It might have engaged with the pictures more than just the beat by beat it gives you.I realize that I've not said anything about Black Panther himself. He's alright. He doesn't look a thing like Thurgood Marshall but that's not a big thing in this case. Sometimes it can be off putting. Sometimes it can be at the expense of who the character is internally. This does that somewhat. The case is the focal point.I give this movie a C.\\n\\t17. A look at the career of Thurgood Marshall. Maybe more people will know who he is and what exactly he accomplished.Kudos entire cast was riveting!\\n\\t18. Packed house last night at the AMC Lincoln Center Theater for the NY Times Film Club premiere, a crowd of old white presumably liberal folk with a noticeably Jewish vibe. What you'd expect from the Times Film Club, I suppose, but the absence of black faces was very strange, and put the whole experience out of kilter for me. The film seems aimed at a much younger and blacker audience. When, at the beginning of the film, Boseman offhandedly ordered Gad to carry his bags, and Gad complied immediately, the lone outburst of \\\"Whoa!\\\" fell into almost total (shocked?) silence. That set the tone for me. Marshall is flat-out superhero here, the master bringing sidekick Friedman rapidly up to speed on the state of the Real World. That Waking Up Friedman subplot runs in and out of the main courtroom rape drama, where Sterling K Brown and Kate Hudson nearly steal the show with their far more realistic turns as Spell and Strubing, and James Cromwell and Dan Stevens are skin-crawlingly detestable as judge and prosecutor stooping ever lower to defend the racist ivory tower of Bridgeport CT. How this will do immediately at the box office depends on a lot of other factors, including the trailers. But my guess is that the inherent value of the story, which couldn't be more timely, will connect with audiences on a deep level, while the shenanigans on the surface keep them entertained, and the in the end they'll put it together in their own way. I expect this will be a keeper, something that will be on TV and video for a long, long time, and that \\\"Marshall\\\" will enter the rap lexicon on several levels very quickly.\\n\\t19. 'MARSHALL': Four Stars (Out of Five)A courtroom drama/biopic about the first African-American Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall, and one of his first big cases. The movie stars Chadwick Boseman as Marshall, and it was directed by Reginald Hudlin (some fun trivia, Hudlin wrote the Marvel comic book 'Black Panther', from 2005 to 2008, and Boseman is now playing the character in the Marvel Studios movies). The screenplay was written by Michael and Jacob Koskoff. Josh Gad, Kate Hudson, Sterling K. Brown, Dan Stevens and James Cromwell all costar in the legal drama. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I enjoyed it.The story takes place in 1940 Bridgeport Connecticut. It revolves around Thurgood Marshall (Boseman), an NAACP lawyer who was traveling around the country defending people wrongly accused of crimes due to their color. He's sent to Connecticut to defend a chauffer, named Joseph Spell (Brown), who was accused of raping his employer, a white woman named Eleanor Strubing (Hudson). An insurance lawyer, named Sam Friedman (Gad), attempts to get Marshall admitted to the local bar, but the judge (Cromwell) refuses to allow him tospeak during the trial. So Friedman is forced to become Spell's lead counsel, with Marshall assisting him through notes and whispers. \\n \\nThe movie is a pretty routine courtroom drama, but it's much more involving because of it's social commentary (on the racism of that time). It's got a great cast, especially Boseman in the lead, who makes a very powerful and charismatic leading man. The film is involving, and aptly directed, but it's also mostly predictable. It's still a lot of fun to watch though, and movies about racial injustice are always important.\\n\\t20. As always, when I watch a movie based on real events, I try to compare to what really happened and I usually end up not liking the movie that much because of this. With this one I think they did an excellent job with the case, being pretty faithful to what really happened, with some details changed, but most of it is pretty accurate. Chadwick Boseman turns up another excellent performance as the titular Thurgood Marshall. The production design is impeccable and the courtroom scenes very engaging. So everything seems fine with this movie, with one notable exception, Sam Friedman, here played by Josh Gad. Everything about him is wrong and a total disrespect for the man. This case was mostly won by him with very little help from Marshall, which begs the question, if you wanted to make a movie about Thurgood Marshall why choose a case in which he didn't have that big of an impact, and change everything to make it look like he did? Why not make a movie about his most famous cases? I really can't answer this questions and it casts a giant shadow over the movie.\\n\\t21. Marshall appeared to be written to the audience of people who probably did not know very much about the early NAACP, or Thurgood Marshall in general. The movie did not captivate his pinnacle case \\\"Brown vs Board of Education Topeka\\\" or his ascension to the Supreme Court. The movie did not highlight any of his 32 cases before the United States Supreme Court. This movie was an introductory that raises one's interest in the subject of this man, his contributions to civil rights, and obstacles that faced African Americans during this period of United States History.I would recommend this movie to people who are very knowledgeable of Justice Marshall, or perhaps not fully aware of the ramifications of his life's work. Perhaps millennial, like myself, who cannot fully appreciate the journey and progress of civil rights, were the target audience of this movie.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and think it is currently undervalued. The actor who played Justice Marshall was great, the actor who played Mr. Friedman was excellent as well. I would also like to give a shoutout to the way the movie portrayed the residing judge of this case, because he was a very significant character and his transitions in the movie truly gave the movie a climactic moment that really resonated with me. I would recommend Marshall to any of my friends and thought it was great.\\n\\t22. This film tells the story of a African American lawyer, who fights against social Injustice by helping people who are charged with crimes because of their skin color.\\\"Marshall\\\" tells a compelling story of the fight for the right and just. The story is gripping because it is not an easy fight. Indeed, the African American characters evoke much sympathy and really connects with the viewers. I enjoyed it a lot.\\n\\t23. It is set in Greenwich, Connecticut, in 1941 and is \\\"based on\\\" one of Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall's early civil rights cases when he was a practicing lawyer.Thurgood Marshall (Chadwick Boseman) is a young NAACP staff lawyer sent to Greenwich, Connecticut, to defend Joseph Spell (Sterling K. Brown) against the charge of raping and attempting to kill his white employer, Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson). He was said to have raped her, then bound her, and thrown her off a bridge. However, she managed to swim to shore and then reported the rape. Since Marshall came from out-of-state, he needed a local lawyer to be part of the case. Sam Friedman (Josh Gad) was a Jewish lawyer who only handled civil, not criminal, cases. He was initially reluctant to take the case. The movie depicts Judge Foster (James Cromwell) as biased and the prosecutor, Loris Willis) as an Ivy League snob. The Judge allows Marshall to sit the second chair but not to make arguments or question witnesses, so Marshall coaches Friedman throughout the trial.The movie then details the trial with flashbacks to illustrate Eleanor Strubing's story and later illustrates Joseph Spell's claim that the sex was consensual, that he had initially approached her for money, and that she had invited the sex. He said that Strubing only panicked after the fact and jumped off the bridge of her own volition. Friedman manages to raise doubt based on gaps and contradictions in Strubing's story, and the jury ultimately finds Spell not guilty.This was quite a famous trial when it took place in early 1941. It was a front-page story in the New York Times when the incident happened (the story is in the December 12, 1940 issue of the Times.). Contrary to the film, Sam Friedman and Thurgood Marshall were much more equal than portrayed in the film. Friedman was a bit older and already had a reputation for theatrical performance in courts. He had been hired by the NAACP before Marshall got to town. Indeed, Friedman did act as the lead defense lawyer in the trial. Again contrary to the film, Joseph Spell had admitted from the beginning that he had sex with Eleanor Strubing but always insisted it was consensual. Strubing's contradictory story included a ransom note that was never found and a rope said to have bound her hands that were never found. There were actual doubts about her story from the beginning. Nonetheless, it was a remarkable success story for the NAACP.This is an interesting film. The relationship between Marshall and Friedman includes humor and Friedman's sensibilities arising from his own Jewish background. Chadwick Boseman is excellent as a self-confident black lawyer. Josh Gad is a good complement to the Marshall character.\\n\\t24. Leaving aside the civil justice warrior biography template that's slightly overdone in Hollywood - this film works on every other front. The acting is exceptional, the script and storylines well selected.For a biography, enough shades of grey though there could have been more, the story is an important one. The direction and editing also deserves a mention. The character of Sam is very well created/portrayed and despite the high brow thrill of courtroom drama, it brings home truths and lies close to reality.If not for anything, it is a story of America, its history and its values told from the perspective of one phenomenal man's fight along the way. Watch it for the story if not anything else!\\n\\t25. Before he played the lead in Marvel Studios' superhero sage \\\"Black Panther,\\\" actor Chadwick Boseman played a genuine African-American hero in \\\"Boomerang\\\" director Reginald Hudlin's \\\"Marshall,\\\" a sterling biographical courtroom yarn about civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall. As it turns out, this is the same individual who argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court and then later donned the robes as the first African-American to sit on the highest federal court of the United States. It doesn't hurt matters that seasoned civil rights advocate Michael Koskoff and his son Jacob penned the screenplay. Interestingly, the elder Koskoff still serves as an attorney in Connecticut, where the trial took place in 1941, so he would know something about the hurdles that Marshall had to negotiate. At this point in his life, Marshall worked as the sole legal counsel for the NAACP, and his NAACP superior Walter White (Roger Guenveur Smith of \\\"Eve's Bayou\\\") dispatches him to all parts of the country to defend poor African-Americans who cannot afford an attorney.\\\"Marshall\\\" depicts the title character as a sharp, savvy, sartorially elegant attorney who refused to be intimidated by anybody. Boseman has a field day incarnating this historical personage. Neither Hudlin nor the Koskoffs reveal a great deal about Thurgood Marshall beyond his dedication to the rights of African-Americans in a legal system skewered against them. Indeed, we do learn about the problems that Marshall and his wife Vivien \\\"Buster\\\" Burey (Keesha Sharp of \\\"Malibu's Most Wanted\\\") encountered in their repeated but futile efforts to get pregnant. Eventually, she does have a baby. Nevertheless, Hudlin and the Koskoffs don't let Marshall's own life history interfere with the trial at hand. Mind you, \\\"Marshall\\\" clocks in two minutes short of two hours, but Hudlin doesn't malinger. The trial in question takes place in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The authorities have arrested a middle-aged, African-American chauffeur, Joseph Spell (Sterling K. Brown of \\\"Brown Sugar\\\"), for allegedly raping a Greenwich socialite, Mrs. Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson of \\\"Deepwater Horizon\\\"), and then throwing her into a reservoir late one evening. According to Koskoff, when the press broke the story, one newspaper touted it as \\\"the sex trial of the century.\\\" When Marshall visits Spell in his jail cell, the attorney explains that the NAACP represents only innocent blacks. Spell assures Marshall that he did not rape Strubing. Furthermore, he has an alibi for his whereabouts when the crime occurred, and the witness in question turns out to be a white policeman who is prepared to testify.As the case unfolds, Marshall realizes that he lacks the appropriate credentials to practice law in Connecticut, so he finds a gullible but willing Jewish insurance attorney, Sam Friedman (Josh Gad of \\\"Pixels\\\"), to help him represent Spell. Friedman constantly has second thoughts about the trial and the dire publicity that may irreparably damage his budding civil practice. Nevertheless, he agrees to serve as Spell's mouthpiece. Meantime, the abrasive Judge Foster (James Cromwell of \\\"L.A. Confidential\\\") refuses to let Marshall utter a syllable during the trial and threatens to hold him in contempt if he does. Throughout the trial, Marshall must coach Friedman because the latter hasn't argued a criminal case. If these two strikes against our sympathetic, but snappy hero aren't enough, Marshall discovers about half-way through the case that Spell has been lying to them. Indeed, Spell didn't rape Strubing! Instead, he had intimate consensual relations with her, because her abusive, bad-tempered husband, John Strubing (Jeremy Bobb of \\\"Boy Wonder\\\"), often left her alone at night. Naturally, Friedman struggles to improvise, but he falls into too many traps laid by prosecuting attorney Loren Willis (Dan Stevens of \\\"The Guest\\\"), who is supremely confident that he will win a conviction. Of course, the good citizens of Bridgeport aren't happy with both Marshall and Friedman, and they go after them with fists. Friedman suffers the worst, getting beaten to his knees, and walking away with minor scars on his face. Marshall grins at him and points out that the local press lumped him with Marshall as a crusading NAACP lawyer.\\\"Marshall\\\" qualifies as a well-made but routine courtroom drama bolstered by terrific performances and historical accuracy.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Instructions:\\n  1.

The action is very unique, while also evoking memories of the Wachowskis' work on The Matrix. I really enjoyed the Vangelis-esque score used throughout. It helped create that dark, futuristic atmosphere necessary for the story. Even if you think you see where the story is going, it manages to go in unexpected directions. Between the cool concept, great sets, and dark themes, Upgrade is just that, an upgrade to the typical revenge action thriller.\\\", \\\"Through and through this movie felt like a longer episode of black mirror. The production was higher and the cinematography was really cool. I could see how the stabilization lock on his head during fight scenes could make some people dizzy, but I thought it was a unique way of doing things. Some of the acting was sub-par during the casual interactions, but I thought the plot and action made up for it. It's thought provoking in the way Black Mirror is and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys that content and doesn't mind gore.\\\", \\\"This has seriously become my favorite AI movie to date. I can't believe it was low budget because it's impossible to tell apart from the unknown actors who all do an excellent job. I will do my best to replace its lack of marketing with recommeding it to everyone. I was expecting something entertaining and instead got an amazing plot with a mind-blowing ending. If you enjoy this genre, you can't let this one pass you by. What everyone says is true, it's like a long, perfectly executed Black Mirror episode. I rated it 10 stars for the simple reason that I could not fine anything wrong with it or anything I didn't like. From beginning to end, this movie is amazing. I cannot recommend it enough.\\\", \\\"Brilliant.This movie is proof that you don't need all the special effects in the world to make an amazing sci fi movie. This is low budget done right (think Ex Machina).I signed up to IMDB to review this movie, I was that impressed. I see tons of people making that remark about films but honestly, this movie is unbelievable and for any sci fi fan out there, you need to watch this.I went in blind, no trailer, no knowledge of the movie what so ever and I would advise you do the same.The plot is simple, it's a revenge story that's been done countless times, yet it feels so fresh, acting Is slightly suspect throughout the first 10-15 minutes but the story will grip you, be patient.Honestly, I don't want to give anything away so just watch this movie.9.5/10Easily my favourite sci fi for a LONG time.Enjoy.\\\", \\\"Upgrade is unfortunately in the club of great movies that completely flew under the radar when first released. But that might actually work to its advantage, as this is definitely one of those movies where the less you know going in, the better. The only reason I was aware of Upgrade is because of writer/director Leigh Whannell (Saw, Insidious), and the fact I'd heard plenty of great things from friends who'd seen it. The film takes the all-too-familiar premise of a man looking to avenge the murder of his wife, and puts an interesting new sci-fi spin on it. Whannell clearly loves the classics, because Upgrade's influences are easy to spot - RoboCop, Blade Runner, Dredd, Death Wish. They've all been thrown in a blender, and what comes out is something that feels like its own movie, while also paying tribute to everything that inspired Whannell to become a filmmaker in the first place. Upgrade is violent, thought-provoking, funny, surprising, with some terrific fight sequences, an awesome soundtrack, and a dynamite performance from Logan Marshall-Green. I also get the feeling I'm gonna love it even more the next time I watch it. Highly recommended for fans of sci-fi/action.\\\", \\\"Probably worthy of a bigger production as it's a great science fiction story with comedy action and a few twists.One of those pleasant surprises that you don't expect in an unknown film, I've seen far worse more well known and promoted movies, worth a view.\\\", 'This film is basically \\\"Robocop\\\" meets \\\"Death Wish\\\", with less satire than the former and more humor than the latter. And it\\\\'s a B movie blast. An unrelenting pace, fantastic fight choreography that doesn\\\\'t skimp on the gleeful blood and gore, and never not fun or interesting to look at.Yeah some of the one-liner dialogue as delivered by Logan Marshall-Green feels a bit forced and the plot isn\\\\'t exactly clever or unique, but damn it, it all works and it makes it\\\\'s own beautiful alchemy out of a bunch of borrowed parts. This is cheap genre filmmaking done right.', \\\"I admit to enjoying UPGRADE, a simple science fiction-oriented twist on the usual revenge storyline. I'll say straight away that the plot is nothing special and has been done plenty of times before; it's the use of familiar but new technology that makes this interesting. The identity of the villains and the supporting characters are quite perfunctory, but the direction is inventive and the film particularly shines in the action scenes, so much so that you wish there were more of them. The main actor commits to his part quite neatly and there are enough decent set-pieces to make this an enjoyable watch, more so than plenty of bigger-budgeted fare.\\\", 'After watching this movie you will realize how bad every other major sci-fi has been in the past several years. This is a film with an excellent story, great cast, direction is on point, and the sci-fi is well developed. The gore is in your face ;) but it adds style to the movie and depth to the plot which one realizes later in the movie.A classic to remember. Look forward to seeing this again.', 'This movie has a plot that we have already seen in many movies, it\\\\'s a mix between \\\"Robocop\\\" and \\\"The Crow\\\", so let\\\\'s say that something was very predictable except for the ending that in my opinion was unexpected. One thing I really appreciated were the fight scenes that use a very particular camera movement that gave the right power and importance to the blows, scenes shot really well. I loved the performances of everyone, especially Benedict Hardie and Logan Marshall-Green. Highly recommended film, it may not be the most original thing in the world but it has its strengths.', '\\\"Upgrade\\\" (R, 1:35) is an action horror sci-fi comedy written and directed by Leigh Whannell, writer of the \\\"Insidious\\\" movies, the early \\\"Saw\\\" films, plus \\\"Dead Silence\\\", and director of \\\"Insidious: Chapter 3\\\". This movie was shot in Australia and Whannell and most of his cast are Australian. However, with the accents and the sets, you wouldn\\\\'t know the movie wasn\\\\'t American - and with the (lack of) quality in the last two \\\"Insidious\\\" movies, you wouldn\\\\'t guess that Whannell was behind this gem of a film.Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green, looking a lot like Tom Hardy) is an \\\"old school\\\" auto mechanic in a near future where intelligent, driverless cars are increasingly commonplace. He\\\\'s married to Asha (Melanie Vallejo), an employee at a high-tech company. They live in a house that\\\\'s suitably high-tech as well, operating with voice commands and equipped with a powerful computer embedded in a table top. They\\\\'re very happy... until one night when they\\\\'re on their way back from meeting one of Grey\\\\'s clients, a reclusive computer genius named Eron Keen (Harrison Gilbertson). Their car crashes and they get mugged. Asha is killed and Grey is paralyzed from the neck down, with only his mother to care for him.Eron visits Grey and offers him the opportunity to regain control of his body, with the help of a neck implant called Stem. The surgery succeeds spectacularly, Grey signs a non-disclosure agreement and heads home, promising that, at least for now, it appears to the world that he\\\\'s still a quadriplegic. Grey quickly learns that Stem can talk to him (as voiced by Simon Maiden). Given the lack of progress by a police investigator named Cortez (Betty Gabriel), Grey takes advantage of Stem\\\\'s Alexa-on-steroids capabilities to find the men who killed his wife. Normally not a violent man, Grey finds himself overmatched by these men, who themselves are technologically enhanced, until he learns how Stem can also help him fight. But, alas, avenging his wife\\\\'s death isn\\\\'t as satisfying as Grey might\\\\'ve expected.\\\"Upgrade\\\" is a very appropriate title, given some of the writer-director\\\\'s mediocre movies - and as a comparison to other films in the AI subgenre. This one is a combination of \\\"Deadpool\\\", \\\"Ex Machina\\\", \\\"Transcendence\\\" and the \\\"Bourne\\\" movies, but still feels fresh and creative, visually and narratively. The occasional comedy comes from the combination of Grey adjusting to having Stem\\\\'s cells in his brain and some gallows humor as he pursues his wife\\\\'s killers. The film also features one of the best recent casts you never heard of. The high-quality cinematography, editing, acting, pacing, directing and screenplay (with some late-game twists) makes this one of the most balanced and entertaining movies of 2018. \\\"A\\\"', \\\"I guess you can call this a B-movie, but that's not always a bad thing, and certainly not in this case.It has it's moments and some originality, which is rare in todays Hollywood remake factory.As for the B-movie thing it's worth mentioning the actor(s). The main actor had a little... uhm... stiff delivery.It doesn't hurt the movie in any way, it's a nice use of your time, and I will most likely watch it again.\\\", '\\\\'Upgrade\\\\' takes up many familiar dystopian sci-fi tropes and fuses them into a generic revenge-action movie. And if you came for the action there is a good change you will like this film. The fighting scenes, involving a combination of (slightly overpowered) superhero physics and grindhouse-like violence, certainly look spectacular, especially considering the low budget. However, if you, like me, came for thought-provoking sci-fi you will probably be disappointed. It\\\\'s not that it totally lacks great ideas, on the contrary. By touching on too many interesting topics (humanity\\\\'s increasing dependency on technology, governments and companies experimenting on humans, and, of course, the rise of Artificial Intelligence) you could even argue that the makers bit off more than they could chew. What remains is a cyberpunk action flick that never really goes into depth.The same can also be said of its main characters, all of which seem to lack any emotional complexity. Even the non-enhanced humans in the story often seem to act robotlike. This especially applies to Eron, but also to Grey, who, even though he is supposed to represent humanity in a world dominated by technology, is practically emotionless throughout the entire movie. The underlying problem here seems to be the pace of the film. With a first act taking up no more than ten minutes, the film takes absolutely no time to develop the main characters beyond the archetypes of the \\\"stubborn technophobe\\\", \\\"brilliant but anti-social inventor\\\", and the \\\"happy-go-lucky wife\\\". Not to mention the machine-hybrid cliche supervillain, who is especially hard to take seriously. The limited time you get to spend with these characters makes it even harder to genuinely feel for them as the story unfolds.The film, however, does succeed in bringing to life a dark, grim and empty world that feels painfully familiar and realistic - a sheer contrast with the characters that inhabit it. A scene, for example, that clearly stood out for me was the one with VR-junkies in the worn-out apartment building; it beautifully captured the blurred lines between the \\\"real\\\" and the \\\"fake\\\" that we increasingly seem to experience in everyday life. But even during these rare brilliant moments, the film felt rushed and overshadowed by action sequences. Admittedly, the ending was pretty surprising, but this could hardly compensate for structural flaws of the film. All in all, I found it an unfulfilling experience.', \\\"What an unexpectedly brilliant movie. Lots of laughs, some moments that I almost couldn't look, fabulously different story line, last minute surprise ending, car chases, and brilliant fight scenes.\\\", \\\"I think that many of the reviews below have already summed this movie up quite well. It's a standard revenge movie, but with a sci-fi twist and some incredibly impressive fight scenes. It's well-paced, well-acted, has a solid script, and the plot is more interesting and complicated than you might think from seeing the trailers alone.One other thing I really liked about it was the director's vision of the near future. With a few little exceptions (like how a computer chip in your neck can make you defy physics and stand up without bending any limb) the world here is very believable and depicted in such a way that was visually appealing without going too far as to make it look too flashy to be realistic.Don't let the fact that this was made by someone who directed one of the Insidious movies bother you either. This is wayyyyyy better than any of those movies. Director/writer Leigh Whannell has really found his footing here and delivered a movie that's highly entertaining and doesn't pull any punches.\\\", 'Upgrade is a straight-forward, entertaining violent action film about our potential near-future, and it\\\\'s not all that pretty. This movie is just like a Black Mirror episode, a modernistic yet pessimistic view of how technology is evolving. Some are for it, others are not. The anti-technology theme here is quite clear: Asimov may have been right.First, what did Upgrade do right? Well it\\\\'s certainly intense, with some really sweet fight scenes and unique choreography. The camera work was fun too. It\\\\'s an engaging story, good acting, overall a fantastic movie if you love sci-fi and violence.However, there were some issues. For one, the fight scenes were disappointingly few and far in between. I may have been misled by other reviews, but do not go in expecting something like \\\"The Raid\\\" movies. Some plot holes were spotted, and on a personal level, I do not go looking for those while enjoying a movie. Additionally, the plot holes were as obvious as the plot was predictable. So don\\\\'t expect any ground-breaking story here.But its intentions weren\\\\'t to grab an Oscar in Best Original Script, or any Oscar for that matter. Its intents were evidently to entertain those who just wanted a great sci-fi action thriller without having to think too much, and to warn us of possible dangers lurking behind the excitement of the modern evolution of technology. So, I guess enjoy the movie, but be cautious of that thing on your kitchen counter that tells you the weather and controls the lights.', \\\"As stories go, Upgrade isn't anything particularly spectacular. There's some really good ideas of course, but the idea of cyborgs and AI taking over humanity are as old as technology itself. It also surprisingly draws parallels to a superhero movie released in the same year; Venom, where a normal Tom Hardy-looking guy finds himself possessed by an entity that helps him get what he wants by controlling his body. Where Upgrade really shines is in its execution. The build-up leading to multiple multi-layered twists upon each other lend the film an unpredictable narrative complexity, where multiple rewatches are guaranteed to illuminate more subtle complexities, callbacks, and foreshadowing.Something that really makes Upgrade stand out is Logan Marshall-Green, who offers a truly impressive physical performance that is both demanding and complicated to achieve. The controlling of his body by an AI leads to some stylish fight choreography, and Marshall-Green doesn't stutter in adding robotic, calculated movements to those scenes, while simultaneously acting in juxtaposition with his head and facial expressions. He's confused and bewildered while he slices a guy up with a kitchen knife, he brags and gloats while his body effortlessly dispatches of goons, he pleads with bad guys not to continue fighting while his robotic-moving arms quickly and decisively disarm and dispatch of them. He holds such an impressive disconnect between his head and his body that I couldn't even imagine how hard it must have been to develop such physical coordination while acting and making it look effortless at the same time. Marshall-Green has never particularly impressed me before, but he has now.Even further though are clever uses of cameras adding another dimension to the film's visual identity. The high points are, again, the fight scenes, where the camera is just as involved in the choreography as the actors and stuntmen are. To add an even greater emphasis on the disconnect between Grey's mind and his body, the camera often keeps him fixed in frame while the settings around him movie. He's just enjoying the ride while his body does the moving, and we're put in that mindset. The way they did it is mount the camera in a rotating frame, hide a phone on Marshall-Green's body, and get them to match orientation. When Marshall-Green moves, the camera moves with him. This becomes especially impressive when Grey ducks and dives, or does full-on back-flips, and the camera mirrors his movements perfectly.Beyond that, the cinematography goes a long way to make this low-budget movie look much more expensive. Lighting is dim and harsh, camera angles are conservative yet stylish, and the CGI is used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary, which has a knock-on effect of grounding an otherwise futuristic world without getting too lofty. The score by Jed Palmer is also fantastic. I was maybe a little disappointed that Whannell didn't go for a Saw-esque climatic track for the third-act revelations, but nonetheless the score is evocative of sci-fi movies of the 70s and 80s, with borderline synthwave tracks interspersed amongst more ambient sounds.Upgrade is a solid sci-fi flick that manages to be refreshing and unique despite its otherwise overdone story elements. It ended up being a better Venom movie than Venom. All it took was an imaginative filmmaker like Leigh Whannell. I honestly can't wait to see what he manages to do next. I give Upgrade a solid 8/10.\\\", \\\"'Upgrade' is a hybrid action/comedy/horror flick written and directed by Leigh Whannell, who previously brought us the highly successful 'Saw' and 'Insidious' franchises.It stars Logan Marshall-Green, who shall forever be known as Tom Hardy's doppelganger (seriously--compare photos), opposite Betty Gabriel, a rising star famous for her turn in the breakout hit 'Get Out.'While the acting and overall concept are both quite remarkable, there's an unmistakable clunkiness to the film, alternating between the dialogue, blocking, and editing.However, the cinematography is superb, especially on such a low budget, and the action sequences when the bio-mechanical aspect of the film are fully utilized simply aren't to be missed.\\\", 'I went into this with fairly low expectations. The trailer looked good, and the cinematography looked exciting. But the premise seemed tired and worn.*in a deep, movie-voice over voice* some guys kill his wife, and now he\\\\'s seeking revenge\\\".But this film surpassed my expectations, and was a well-worth experience. Not only was I correct about the cinematography being exciting and engaging, but the plot actually strung together compelling way. This film came out of nowhere for me, and now, it\\\\'s a memorable film that accomplishes the most important goal of any great film: gets the audience to keep wondering about it.Since I don\\\\'t want to go into spoilers, I\\\\'ll say one last thing: pay attention to the Foley artist\\\\'s work. The sound design is poignant and additive to the experience. It reminds me of the clever usage of music from Baby Driver. Nothing is wasted and is always enriching of the world building. With Baby Driver, the music was giving us Baby\\\\'s personal experience. Here, the sound effects give us Grey\\\\'s point of view. Didn\\\\'t experiences, but both are elevated through sound, masterfully.I genuinely want to see it again. If the trailer interested you at all, go see it. It\\\\'s worth your while.', \\\"Not a lot of buzz was made about this film which kind of landed in theaters with no hype. I saw one trailer at some point and knew I wanted to check it out. Logan Marshall-Green isn't exactly someone who is a leading man. Ryan Atwood's brother and a role in Prometheus are his most notable roles. So it was nice to see him as a lead, and a lesser known cast in this film. Overall, I felt the plot can be tweaked at some points but its a fun film.The film is about a man named Grey, who becomes paraplegic after he and his wife were attacked by a group of hitmen. He is approached by a tech innovator who puts a device in his body which allows him to walk and control his limbs again.. in a way. The device is actually a smart system called STEM and sometimes STEM is allowed to take over, especially when Grey is in danger. Grey uses this newfound ability to track down the men who killed his wife.Insidious: Chapter 3 wasn't overly memorable for me so I feel like this film is where Leigh Whannell puts a stamp on his film making style. The action scenes are excellent when they come. The chase and combat on screen are stellar. The film does well to use its futuristic setting to set a landscape for the film, which itself still feels modern. The film also has humor at the right times. Its not overbearing but when it comes it feels right.My main concerns with the film was the underdeveloped side characters and there's a bit of convenience when need be. The plot feels like it could have been worked in a less cloudy manner but its not a major detraction from the rest of the effort. Its a surprisingly different effort. We've seen this type of film before but the film still seems to remain fresh and fun. Not really a title people are going to talk about this year but its good fun and that's good enough.7/10\\\", 'Really enjoyed this movie. A very good dose of future technology and where it would lead us to. We are already seeing the birth of some of the concepts shown in this movie and like with any technology there will be good usage and bad.\\\\nI dont understand the bad comments on violence as it is \\\"indirect\\\" (without giving away).\\\\nFast paced and suspenseful. Logan Marshall-Green acted well without any \\\"overacting\\\" or showing off. Screen play and direction were very good. It is original concept and I did not see any connection with Death wish or other movies - not even close or people did not understand the movie?', 'Upgrade greatly exceeded my expectations: truly entertaining, and remarkably well produced. Great acting by the lead character. Stylistically speaking, it\\\\'s perfect: very good cinematography, amazing fight choreography, beautiful scenography and music, perfect CGI, and the overall \\\"feel\\\" of the atmosphere. Only 5 millions were spent. Often, you will not find that attention for scenography and CGI in Hollywood productions.\\\\nIn the end, it\\\\'s a little nice movie with a standard plot that nonetheless got me hooked: it got more and more entertaining, and then some more. There are many cliches, but that\\\\'s a plus: when the director is good, having a cliche smoothly inserted into the story is pure fun. Each of the main events has a reason to be and a nice explanation (sometimes, it\\\\'s quite original), so that the story never really feels that \\\"standard\\\".\\\\nThere are just a couple of minor holes here and there, but nothing like what you will read in some reviews: infact, the structure is perfectly logic, and if part of the audience doesn\\\\'t pay attention, that\\\\'s not movie\\\\'s fault.Ps: forgot to mention... I realized I never saw a movie depicting cyber-bio-implants or whatever. Blade Runner does not, Ex-Machina does not, Strange days does not. This movie finally does.', 'If you wanted to see \\\"Venom\\\" but didn\\\\'t want to be distracted by all of the high end special effects and quality acting from Tom Hardy then \\\"Upgrade\\\" is the movie for you\\\\nLogan Marshall Green puts in a brilliant \\\"I\\\\'m not Tom Hardy\\\" performance. His inner dialogue with Kit from \\\"Knight Rider\\\" is beyond reproach.\\\\nTwo thumbs!', \\\"After ten minutes I came close to switching it off, as I couldn't get into it, it felt as though they were spending too much time showing off future technology, however I stuck with it, and was glad I did, as it develops it really does open up, it became a wonderfully gripping and entertaining sci fi thriller. Very well acted throughout, a pretty original story, and lots of action scenes.The accident really does change the movie up, and the tone, it really is well worth a look, the ending may come as a surprise for some.Very good, 8/10.\\\"]\",\n          \"[\\\"I love Shakespeare, but I've also always had a soft spot for Ophelia. This reimagining of Hamlet is not faithful to the original text, so have an open mind and you may enjoy it. I don't generally like movies that apply modern sensibilities to classic stories and characters, but this one was tolerable. The acting was fine, the sets and costumes beautiful. Overall it was a fine film. But if you're a purist, don't bother.\\\", \\\"I don't understand why the reviews for this one are so bad. I found this movie quite enjoyable. The acting seemed fine to me and the scenery and costume designs were really lovely. I enjoyed watching this movie a lot. I suppose those looking for the traditional portrayal of Hamlet might be disappointed. I enjoyed the updated dialogue and storyline from Ophelia's point of view. Give it a chance - you'll likely be pleased you did.\\\", \\\"Hard to believe the hostility directed against this movie.\\\\nIt's not Hamlet, but another take on the story from the viewpoint of Ophelia. The director chose to show the protagonist as a strong women.\\\\nEnjoyed the character development and the storyline. Directing was solid. All the actors were quite believable in their roles.\\\", \\\"I watched this because I wanted to see what Daisy Ridley's acting was like outside of Star Wars. I had seen her in Murder on the Orient Express, but her role was relatively small in that. This film isn't incredibly exciting, but Ridley certainly gives a fine performance as a fleshed-out Ophelia. The other actors carry themselves well, in addition; and the period sets, costumes, and locations are convincing.\\\", \\\"This was enjoyable in my opinion. I've seen Hamlet. I've read the play. This is not an exact remake of the original work but I liked that it was a reimagining.In this film, Ophelia is our main character and we seen how things unfold from her perspective. Her role in the original work is a big deal seeing as she was the innocence in a corrupt court who was driven to insanity and then suicide after the deaths of the men she loved most. Suicide was her escape from all the revenge, evil and madness taking place around her. Here we see her much more resilient without losing her innocent nature. The basic plot of the film is still present but things don't go down the same way.I thought it was filmed well and the acting was good. I thought the concept presented was creative. I'm sure that a lot of folks will take issue and feel like it was to far removed from the original work but if you take it for what it is rather than point out all the differences, it was a good film. I say check it out.\\\", \\\"It is not surprising the name of the costume designer features so early in the credits because he played a major role in making this film so watchable. All those gorgeous costumes must have cost a bit but along with some splendid d\\u00e9cor, ecclesiastical and baronial interiors (and a few exteriors) and outdoor scenes of woods glades and hills this film never fail to offer pleasure for the eye. The story proceeds at a sufficient pace with some unexpected twists and turns while bringing out how empty and unsatisfying royal or any great power can be. Is it really worth fighting so hard for? Pity about the mayhem of the penultimate scene, it was unnecessary, but makes Ophelia's choice at the end seem a wise one.\\\", 'Critics seem to have difficulties agreeing on whether this is a spin-of of Hamlet to tell Ophelia\\\\'s story, or simply Hamlet\\\\'s story told from Ophelia\\\\'s POV. I tend to side with the former.\\\\nOne thing definitely reimagined here is that Ophelia is no longer a helpless, passive victim eventually driven to madness. She is all courage, intelligence, wit, spirit, resourceful, and more. And why not, if she is played by Daisy Ridley whom we know best as Rey, the new heroine in the third and final trilogy of the Star Wars saga that spanned the silver screen for over 4 decades. Incidentally, in about 2 months, our patience will be rewarded with the answer to Rey\\\\'s real heritage. But I digress.\\\\nAmong other things, this movie has a generous offer of witty word plays. Right at the start, when Ophelia as a child (Mia Quiney) is taken under the wings of Queen Gertrude (Naomi Watts), the first exchange includes the Queen\\\\'s mild exclamation of \\\"Alas, indeed\\\", which is turned by the witty Ophelia into \\\"a lass\\\", as she is often mistaken for a boy in her tomboyish childhood.\\\\nIn the first encounter (not counting stealing glances at each other at a distance) between Ophelia and Hamlet (George MacKay), she is fully submerged in serene lake water when surprised by him and Horatio on shore. Hamlet promptly commented that as she is a lady-in-waiting, perhaps she wouldn\\\\'t mind waiting a bit longer. They would not inconvenience themselves on her account with looking for another spot for fishing. Totally unruffled, Ophelia teasingly emerges from water in tantalizingly slow motion, only to have the jaw-dropping Hamlet finally discover that she is fully clothed (Horatio has already walked away in embarrassment). That is a most definitive establishing scene of Ophelia.\\\\nOther depiction of Ophelia includes \\\"she dances like a goat\\\" (as per the other ladies-in-waiting). B then, she is \\\"a girl that can read\\\", surprising Gertrude who immediately gets even as Ophelia finds that her bedside reading to the queen is not a book of religious devotion but passionate novels of romance.\\\\nIn this movie, the Shakespearean English has been modernized, exemplified in probably the best-known fatherly advice, \\\"Neither a borrower nor a lender be\\\". Here, what Polonius says to Laertes becomes \\\"Do not borrow any money or lend it\\\". Incidentally if you find the face of the actor who plays Ophelia\\\\'s brother Laertes familiar, you should. This is none other than Tom Felton, otherwise better known as Draco Malfoy in Harry-Potter-verse. But I digress again.\\\\nFor the top-tier star presence, in addition to Ridley and Watts, there is also Clive Owen who plays the usurping uncle Claudius, most likely with more malice than you have seen anywhere else before. Note also that Watts plays not just one character, but two! Entirely new to the plot is Mechtild, a mysterious witch from whom Gertrude obtains potions for preservation of youthful looks. She also carries a secret that affects the big picture but let me not spoil it. Similarly, I will not spoil the plot which initially follows the Bard\\\\'s but later throws in some twists.\\\\nAs mentioned in my \\\"headline\\\", this movie has aa art-house feel, but is not get overboard. The pace, for one thing, is brisk. The cinematography is first-rate, as well as costume design. There is much to enjoy, if this is your cup of tea.', \\\"I didn't know what to expect but I thought it was a pretty cool movie. I don't know much about Hamlet but I was entertained. Bravo.\\\", \\\"I read the book by Lisa Klein that this is based on as a teenager. I loved it, so I might be a bit biased, but I didn't mind the changes to the Hamlet story. I thought the costumes, sets, and everything where gorgeous. The casting is good and most of the actors do the best they can with weakly written dialogue. My other TINY complaint is that they changed the ending from the book where she ends up with Horatio.Also, ignore the people who complain about having actors of different races in a medieval story. It's the 21st century. I think it's okay to cast the actor who is best for the role without getting hung up on race.\\\", '\\\"Ophelia\\\" is a Drama - Romance movie in which we watch Hamlet from Ophelia\\\\'s perspective. She was raised by Queen Gertrude in Elsinore Castle and she had some feelings for Prince Hamlet. Passion, romance, vengeance combined in this movie.I found this movie interesting and different since it\\\\'s from a different perspective than usual. The direction which was made by Claire McCarthy was good and she presented well her main characters and the plot behind her movie. The interpretation of Daisy Ridley who played as Ophelia was good and her combination with some other actors/actresses created a good result. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Naomi Watts\\\\'s who played as Gertrude / Mechtild, Clive Owen\\\\'s who played as Claudius and George MacKay\\\\'s who played as Hamlet. Finally, I have to say that \\\"Ophelia\\\" is an interesting movie and I recommend you to watch it just from curiosity.', 'Never mind all the fake early ten-star reviews here--if you can\\\\'t tell they\\\\'re fake from the writing, click on the person\\\\'s handle and you\\\\'ll see that inevitably they have never posted about another movie before.This movie gets five stars for being well-produced, good-looking, professionally acted and crafted. I can\\\\'t argue that it would probably entertain less discriminating (and younger) audiences, esp. if they have no prior experience with \\\"Hamlet.\\\" (God help the high school student who one day is going to figure they can skip reading the play and do a book report just from seeing this film.) But if you ARE at all familiar with \\\"Hamlet,\\\" this is is pretty ludicrous. It\\\\'s not that it departs from the play in many ways; \\\"Hamlet\\\" is such a ubiquitous classic that it can certainly withstand and even welcome some imaginative, revisionist takes.(partial spoilers ahead] The probolem is that this particular take is that of a stereotypical current teenage romance-novel-slash-fantasy a la \\\"Twilight\\\" and \\\"Wicked.\\\" Poor Ophelia must of course be a spunky little rebel who only PRETENDS to go mad, won\\\\'t let men tell her what to do, and other things that seem more than a bit preposterous for a young lady in a medieval Danish court. Of course Hamlet is ALL about her, in a brooding, lovesick, tormented Robert Pattinson-in-\\\"Twilight\\\" way. Things are manipulated so crazily to make O. the center of this whole story that she even sees the Ghost of Hamlet\\\\'s father before he does! Because she is just that special.Gertrude is made to be bitchy and insecure, reducing Naomi Watts\\\\' performance; Clive Owen is solid as Claudius, and other performances are OK. But it\\\\'s distracting that another concession to young audiences is making the court multi-ethnic, as if there were many black people around in 11th-century Denmark or whenever this is supposed to be. It\\\\'s not that this is quasi-modernized, which needn\\\\'t be a bad thing; it\\\\'s that it\\\\'s done in such a stereotypical, shallow, trendy fashion that the effect is ultimately kinda laughable.You can\\\\'t say this is really a \\\"feminist\\\" take, because it\\\\'s too juvenile in its approach--Ophelia may be somewhat \\\"empowered,\\\" but she\\\\'s also the girl whom the Prince himself offers to \\\"walk away from it all\\\" for! She\\\\'s supposed to be \\\"tough,\\\" in a sort of Katniss-in-\\\"Hunger Games\\\" way, but she also gets to be Cinderella, too. If you\\\\'re getting the feeling from my description that this movie piles up way too many cliches in order to hit the target audience bull\\\\'s-eye, you\\\\'d be exactly right. But jiudging from the film\\\\'s reception so far, obviously you can OVERESTIMATE what your audience presumably wants, and give them so much of it that they feel condescended to. This expensive-looking movie is pretty much going straight to VOD, and that is because it is more 21st-century \\\"Gidget\\\" than \\\"Hamlet.\\\" Doing the story from Ophelia\\\\'s point of view was a good idea--and someday, someone may do it right.', 'As a huge fan of Shakespeare, I truly enjoyed this alternate take on the tale of Hamlet and Ophelia. The star-studded cast was a delight to watch deliver superb performances. The sets were absolutely breathtaking and the costuming was tasteful and evocative. The film was a rich feast of color and the music touched my heart. I found myself singing along with the theme and humming it after the end of the movie. I just love that a woman wrote the book, another the screenplay and the director was female as well. This definitely is a step in the right direction of telling \\\"herstory\\\" to take its rightful place aside \\\"history\\\".', \\\"People are very harsh. Okay it's not Shakespeare- no pun intended- it's still pretty fun if not heavy on the PC stuff. Naomi Watts in two roles is always dependable. Clive Owens is a bit scary, the wig ... worth a watch if you're fan fiction kinda person.\\\", \\\"Characters act like it's happening in 21st century: winking, rolling eyes at each other, etc. Ruins the authenticity of the period of time its based in.\\\", 'I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. It seems to have polarized movie-goers, many \\\"1\\\" votes and many \\\"10\\\" votes. I quite like it, the movie has an interesting story and is acted and filmed very well.I have the advantage of not knowing very much at all about Shakespeare\\\\'s \\\"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\\\" , the source play for the book and now the movie. As the filmmakers explain, this is a re-imagining of the basic story with more focus on Ophelia and Queen Gertrude, and what the complexity of their characters might have been. Die-hard Shakespeare fans most likely take issue, anything that changes from his various versions would likely be considered unforgivable sins.But taken as a story greatly \\\"inspired\\\" by the play, with some significant changes and trajectory for Ophelia, it works very well, at least it does for me. Not a great movie but certainly very watchable and suitably entertaining. Not a \\\"10\\\", not a \\\"1\\\", somewhere between those extremes.Daisy Ridley is really good as Ophelia, playing her as a reasonable but strong person. I don\\\\'t really know much of his work but George MacKay (mac-eye) works well as Hamlet and Naomi Watts as Gertrude.', 'There are so many expeditions into the forest and a cave that are made by Ophelia in this film that it is easy to confuse \\\"Ophelia\\\" with \\\"Dora and the Lost City of Gold\\\"!Tom Stoppard\\\\'s \\\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\\\" was a play and later a film that showed Shakespeare\\\\'s \\\"Hamlet\\\" from the perspectives of two schlubs who are given their fifteen minutes of fame. By contrast, \\\"Ophelia\\\" deconstructs Shakespeare\\\\'s narrative not only to unfold the action from Ophelia\\\\'s point of view, but it also completely reinvents the character and the narrative.In the bonus track of the DVD of \\\"Ophelia,\\\" one of the film\\\\'s producers described their Ophelia as a \\\"spitfire,\\\" and within the film itself, she describes herself to us as \\\"willful.\\\" The director, Claire McCarthy, noted a \\\"tongue-in-cheek\\\" stylistic approach to the Shakespearean classic in the way that characters and events are entirely changed.Some of the most outrageous choices were have Ophelia marry Hamlet! The ceremony takes place in the forest in the style of Friar Lawrence overseeing the ceremony of Romeo and Juliet tying the knot. The quick-thinking Ophelia is also making rounds on the ramparts of Elsinore late at night on the lookout for the Ghost. Ophelia and Hamlet are both aware of that eavesdropping is occurring in a crucial scene, so they begin to whisper to each other as Claudius and Polonius are listening in. This Ophelia also does not go mad, but rather feigns the madness, giving an award-winning performance of the staged mad songs in front of the court. But the most radical change is that Ophelia stages her own death, giving the impression that she has drowned in the river!The filmmakers clearly wanted to avoid any semblance of Ophelia as a victim. In the bonus track of the DVD, McCarthy reiterated how this Ophelia was to have \\\"agency\\\" in her life. She begins as a commoner, then rises to the level of handmaiden to Queen Gertrude, prior to marrying the Prince of Denmark, and ultimately living to become a widow and proud single mom!The film was directed by a woman, and the screenplay was written by a woman, based on a woman\\\\'s novel. The featured characters, Ophelia and Gertrude, were woman, and a new female character of the \\\"healer\\\" named Mechtild, is Gertrude\\\\'s sister, who is always available to provide poisons, potions, and cure-alls in her cave.To crown it off, there is the convent of St. Emilion, where women who are harassed at the court may flee to safety. The protagonist will in time avail herself of the sanctuary afforded by St. Emilion. So, when Hamlet tells Ophelia, \\\"Get thee to a nunnery,\\\" he is providing the most important advice that will help to ensure victory for our Super Heroine, turning her into an Ophelia for our time!!', \\\"Based on the novel by Lisa Klein, the film follows the story of Hamlet from Ophelia's perspective. The movie boasts of a talented cast, tells the story on a different and interesting point of view and has a great ending. Unfortunately it suffers from some script's problems and sometimes it isn't as gripping as it should have been.Rating: 6,5.\\\", \\\"As a rebellious and motherless child , orphan Ophelia (Mia Quiney) is taken into Elsinore Castle by Queen Gertrude (Naomi Watts) as one of her most trusted ladies-in-waiting and at the luxury palace she meets a young Hamlet (Jack Cunningham) .

Entertaining, engaging enough to hold my interest, with an interesting plot.\\\", \\\"I really don't understand why there are so many really negative reviews and positive reviews being downvoted. Is it Daisy? Is it that someone's approached Shakespeare from a new angle?I'll never find out the answer but it's a real shame.I really loved this movie. I wasn't sure on Daisy in this kind of role having only seen her in Star Wars before but I actually think she played it beautifully. I have seen someone else say they think this would have been a Kiera Knightley role ten years ago and I agree, but she would have ruined it. It needed to be understated. It needed to be timid as well as strong. None of that makes sense I suppose but in my head it does.I'm not a fan of Naomi Watts or Clive Owen but they were watchable and actually I cried for Naomi's Gertrude at the end.The costumes are gorgeous, the scenery and settings beautiful and the soundtrack is wonderful, especially the music playing over the ending scenes.It made me interested in Hamlet again.\\\", \\\"As a person who never read Shakespeares' work and is not familiar with this story, I think this movie was just okay.Pros - the production design and cinematography is kinda cool.

Even though some actors tries their best and you can kinda see it, but the script doesn't explore or develop these characters that much. They didn't feel interesting other than Ophelia.

Sterling K Brown is great and one of the greatest actors in recent years. It was different but enjoyable seeing Josh Gad in a drama. I wish they would make more of these movies that follow Thurgood Marshall's journey. The only negative thing is that it felt a bit long.\\\", 'Greetings again from the darkness. The question must be asked: is the movie worthy of the man? The man was the first attorney for the NAACP. He won 29 of the 32 cases he argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, including the ground-breaking 1954 Brown v. Board of Education (separate but equal public education). This man was a trailblazer for Civil Rights, and in 1967 became the first African- American Supreme Court Justice. This man was, of course, Thurgood Marshall \\\\x85 a man who unquestionably deserves not just a movie, but a really good and important one.Chadwick Boseman has taken on film versions of such icons as Jackie Robinson in 42 and James Brown in GET ON UP, so he likely jumped at the chance to play the revered figure, Thurgood Marshall. Mr. Boseman has true movie star screen presence, and supplies the young Mr. Marshall with a self-assured swagger that accompanies a brilliant legal mind \\u2013 a mind that refused to be ignored during a time it was desperately needed. Lest he be labeled a superhero, the film does portray Marshall smoking and drinking, while also hinting at his carousing. The common flaws of a great man.It\\\\'s 1941 and the young (33 years old) Marshall is the lone NAACP attorney, so he spends his time ping-ponging around the country fighting for fair trials for those African-Americans accused simply because they aren\\\\'t white. He works only for \\\"innocent\\\" people and his efforts during this time were crucial to the Civil Rights movement gaining attention and legitimacy. Most of the film centers on a case in Connecticut (no, not the Jim Crow south) where a black man, Joseph Spell (Sterling K Brown), is accused of sexual assault of a \\\"respectable\\\" married white woman, Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson). If you are reminded of the great book and film TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, you must know that those literary and cinematic standards are such that few can ever hope to reach.What follows is not one of the more dramatic or tension-filled cinematic courtroom dramas. There is simply too much levity for the film to be classified as a historical heavyweight. That said, the man and his story are fascinating, and though director Reginald Hudlin chooses a deft touch rather than a sledge hammer, it\\\\'s likely the wise choice if the goal is to entertain, while also educating the masses to Marshall\\\\'s early career. Josh Gad co-stars as Marshall\\\\'s co-counsel Sam Friedman, a specialist in legal technicalities within the insurance industry. Boseman and Gad have nice chemistry (at times it feels like a buddy movie), and as a Jew in those times, Friedman is himself stuck in limbo between staunch racism and acceptance by the white community.James Cromwell plays Judge Foster, yet another man caught between the old world he has lived in his entire life and the fast-changing society and legal system that permits him to silence Marshall, while also forcing (somewhat) fair treatment of the accused Spell. Dan Stevens (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST) is Loren Willis, the disgusted and disgusting prosecutor. This character is so cartoonish that the only thing missing is a neon necklace that flashes \\\"racist\\\" as he speaks. Sophia Bush has a brief, yet important scene and Sterling K Brown (as Mr. Spell) has the film\\\\'s most heart-breaking moment as he sits on the stand and explains why he lied.Director Reginald Hudlin seems like an odd choice for the project. He has been working mostly in TV since back-to-back-to-back bombs BOOMERANG (Eddie Murphy), THE LADIES MAN (Tim Meadow) and SERVING SARA (Matthew Perry). Mr. Hudlin has experienced more success as a Producer, having been Oscar nominated for DJANGO UNCHAINED. Here he works with the father and son screenwriters Jacob Koskoff and Michael Koskoff. The elder Michael is a well respected criminal attorney and legal historian, and certainly understands the expectations that come with offering a public look at a near- mythical figure \\\\x85 especially one as revered as Thurgood Marshall.This isn\\\\'t so much a movie about the icon as it is about a young man on the path to greatness and importance (he served on the Supreme Court from 1967-1991). The soundtrack is filled with jazz which complements the light-hearted approach, and further distances from any semblance of \\\"heavy\\\" or \\\"historical\\\". Director Hudlin adds a contemporary touch by having Trayvon Martin\\\\'s parents (Sybrina Fulton, Tracy Martin) appear in a scene near the end. On the downside, multiple upshot camera angles are designed to make his lead character look larger than life. The truth is, Thurgood Marshall required no help in looming large. Hopefully this mainstream approach pays off and many are introduced to the legacy of a man who is more than worthy of this movie \\\\x85 and another.', 'I got to attend an early screening of Marshall tonight. I\\\\'m interested to see how critics react. I have a feeling many of them will object to the \\\"paint-by-numbers\\\" approach to the film. While we have not seen Thurgood Marshall represented much in film, it does feel like we\\\\'ve seen this movie more than once before. But that isn\\\\'t really the point. I\\\\'ve eaten spaghetti and meatballs hundreds of times before. I still enjoy it each time, the same dish, so long as it is made well. And Marshall, while not reinventing any wheels, is made well. Chadwick Boseman leads a terrific cast that includes Josh Gad, Dan Stevens, James Cromwell, Kate Hudson and Sterling K. Brown. Everyone is there to give this very important true story some depth and weight. At the same time, the screenplay never gets too caught up in its own self-importance. While some very dark themes and tragic events are present, there is a sense of humor pervading much of the film. This makes the people and events portrayed in Marshall relatable, instead of feeling like we\\\\'re watching a group of untouchable, stoic historical figures. Marshall isn\\\\'t designed to inspire anger or guilt, instead it encourages us to examine examples of unity that have been used to overcome struggle. It has more in common with films like The Help or Hidden Figures, than more aggressive films like Detroit (though that film is very intense and impressive). I would say Marshall will play out just as well at home as it does in a theater, but there is something about seeing it with a crowd that in this case adds to the experience. The gasps of the audience when an atrocity is displayed, the clapping when a bigot loses his/her battle-it is a good film to enjoy with an audience. From a technical standpoint, the film does not go out of its way to impress. The cinematography, costume and production design, music, editing-all seems serviceable if not particularly memorable. In this case its the story and the figures it portrays that you\\\\'ll remember. 7/10.', 'Growing up one of the first influential black figures I learned about was Supreme Court Judge Thurgood Marshall. While my life didn\\\\'t veer in the path he took, it was a chance for me as a young black male to see the dedication and time he took to his craft and where it could take you. Almost 2 decades have passed since then, and found myself surprised to see a film finally based on him and his capabilities. While the younger me was excited, I found myself wondering how this film would hold up side by side with other black period films like itself in recent history.Thurgood (Chadwick Boseman) is working in the NAACP when he is tapped for a court case of the accusation of a black male rumored to have raped a woman and thrown her off into the river and left for dead. While he travels to Connecticut for the trial, he finds himself hard pressed given he is a out of town lawyer unfamiliar to the client, and is left to have a inexperienced attorney (Josh Gad) to speak on his behalf in court. While Thurgood knows most of the material and how to move in court, he has to show Josh\\\\'s character the way to observe things his way.The performances are all relatively solid by no surprise given the cast. Josh Gad is able to sell the inexperienced character almost having to be hand held through every decision made in the courtroom. Also the development of him progressively becoming more confident as time goes forward. The writing in the courtroom is interesting enough to keep you invested in knowing what\\\\'s the truth and the holes in one plaintiff and defendants stories.Alas, my biggest issue with the film is really the lasting impact. While it is perfectly watchable in the moment, I felt as if a story like this should have had more lasting impact than what I saw given it\\\\'s a film in a movie theater. It\\\\'s not as riddled with clich\\u00e9s like preceding films I\\\\'ve seen in the past, but misses a strong distinctive voice. For some the issues I had with Hidden Figures, I at least know who the target audience was for the film and what they wanted to take from the movie. Marshall doesn\\\\'t really have that same feeling. The writing is never bad, but never as sharp as it feels like it should be until the second half when more gets revealed.Marshall in a nutshell I would say is \\\"almost there\\\" as a movie. Fine within the moment but leaves a bit desired when the credits rolled. I wouldn\\\\'t turn anyone away from seeing this, but may be best suited seen at home.', 'This enjoyable and inspiring movie is a worthy contribution to the courtroom movie genre. It memorializes the great Thurgood Marshall (who later won Brown v. Bd. of Education and sat on the Supreme Court). The film brings to life a forgotten rape case in Connecticut that Marshall tried early in his career when he was the solo staff lawyer at the NAACP. The story focuses on the plight of a black man accused of raping a white woman and it highlights issues of racism in the courtroom and on the streets. The movie recalls the classic fllms \\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\\" (which also involved a black on white rape case) and \\\"Anatomy of a Murder\\\" (which also involved sexual issues and in which--like many real trials--we\\\\'re never sure just what actually happened and who is telling the truth). The writing is sharp and witty and the acting and direction are great. Particularly strong is the emerging partnership and friendship of Marshall and the local lawyer, Sam Friedman, who had never tried a criminal case and thought he would just sit next to Marshall during the trial and and do nothing. But the judge forces Friedman to conduct the trial with Marshall serving as his adviser--and he rises to the occasion.', 'Whether it\\\\'s the Godfather of Soul, the first black baseball player, or the first black superhero, it\\\\'s fair to say Chadwick Boseman is becoming one of the best actors of his generation.So there was high hopes for this bio-pic about NAACP Civil Rights lawyer and first black supreme court justice Thurgood Marshall.The film looks at one of the first cases of his career; a black chauffeur accused of rape by his white employer in Connecticut. Josh Gad is also in the film as a Jewish lawyer roped into being lead on the case when a judge decrees Marshall can only assist. This is important as the Gadd character has never tried a criminal case before.You keep expecting Boseman to get that nomination sooner or later, \\\"Get on Up\\\" should have been his ticket, but \\\"Marshall\\\" while pretty good in most areas, just doesn\\\\'t feel like it has enough weight to it.I wish they did go with a bigger case of his, or just go all out and go with the one he\\\\'s known most for- Brown v. Board of Education.The movie becomes another case of a black man being railroaded by a biased and corrupt system built on fabrications. For some that may be enough to hold them; the court room scenes that take up most of the movie are often rousing if not predictable.This is all pretty easy-going though- by the second half it\\\\'s pretty much a comedy the lengths most of the white people in this movie will go to to hide their prejudices.At times it almost feels like their trying to start a Thurgood Marshall movie Universe here- like this one may not be that good but we\\\\'ll tease you with some of the better stuff to come if you want it.But even so, Boseman brings life to this character, whether it\\\\'s Marshall\\\\'s perceptiveness or his gift of gab, he\\\\'s cool because he knows he\\\\'s the smartest guy in the room at any given time.Josh Gad has his moments but he still can\\\\'t seem to fully get out of the goofy sidekick role. We\\\\'ll have to see how he does in \\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\\".Oddly enough this is a bio-pic that comes across more as a crowd-pleasing good time than something that\\\\'s going to be remembered at the end of the year, which is fine.I laughed, I was invested in the court trial mostly, the performances, including from Sterling K. Brown as the chauffeur are very good. Yet you just feel like it should have done more.So the score is 7 out of 10.

First there was James Brown the Godfather of Soul, then it was Jackie Robinson the first black player in modern times in major league baseball. Now it is Thurgood Marshall, but Marshall in his early days as a lawyer for the National Association For The Advancement Of Colored People.Thurgood Marshall in his career litigated many major civil rights cases including the most famous of all Brown vs. Board Of Education in 1954 that integrated the school system nationwide. Later on his career was capped by becoming the first black justice on the Supreme Court.This story takes place in the late 30s by the music and the radio broadcasts with the news of the day. Thurgood Marshall has been sent to Connecticut to defend Sterling K. Brown a black chauffeur on a charge of raping his employer Kate Hudson.This may be the north, but the racial attitudes in Greenwich, Connecticut are only more subdued than they are in Alabama. Fairfield County in those days in the richer suburban towns are pretty bad. You remember from Auntie Mame the phrase, Aryan from Darien. They're not crazy about Jews either.Marshall being an outsider to the state has to be admitted to the Connecticut bar. Local attorney Sam Friedman played by Josh Gad is the lead counsel temporarily and the first motion is to get Marshall admitted. That is usually a pro forma thing, note how Matt Damon has to be admitted to the bar in Tennessee in The Rainmaker.Such courtesy is denied Marshall by Judge James Cromwell. But he's allowed to sit at the defense table and coach Friedman. Despite a few curves thrown at the defense Gad who only did civil cases before this for insurance companies proves to be a pretty good advocate.Boseman steps up to his role just as he did with Jackie Robinson and James Brown. He also has some wonderful domestic scenes with his wife Keesha Sharp and at a nightclub with Jussie Smollett and Chilli Thomas as Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. Good performances you think these are the real people.Thurgood Marshall was also portrayed on screen by Sidney Poitier in the film Separate But Equal dealing with the school integration cases right up to the Supreme Court. These two really ought to be seen back to back for a full assessment of Marshall's career.In his time when Lyndon Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court it wasn't just race that made Marshall's appointment unique. It was the whole level of experience in the kind of law he practiced for people like Sterling K. Brown. The goal is justice and the law has to work for all for justice to be realized.Marshall is a film not to be missed.\\\", 'Thurgood Marshall was a legendary lawyer who became the first black judge in the US Supreme Court.Their is a good film to be made about his life, this is not it.Marshall focuses in one attempted murder case that he was involved in back in 1941 when he was a lawyer for the NAACP.It really is a modern version of To Kill a Mockingbird. A black man Joseph Spell is accused of raping a respectable married white woman who employed him. Spell then threw her off a bridge and left her to die.Marshall comes to Connecticut and teams up with a reluctant Jewish insurance lawyer Sam Friedman because the judge would not allow Marshall to be lead counsel.It is an effective courtroom drama, especially as Friedman is an inexperienced criminal lawyer who slowly discovers that there is more to law than insurance litigation.Chadwick Boseman shines as Marshall but there is nothing groundbreaking here as Marshall leads Friedman into the nuances of criminal litigation.', \\\"Marshall is a sleek legal drama with great performances from Chadwick Boseman as the title character and Josh Gad. Don't be fooled by the snazzy vintage costumes, the real heart of Marshall's success is its screenplay and the chemistry between its lead actors.This film follows pioneering Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in his earlier years as a lawyer for the NAACP. A white socialite in Greenwich, Connecticut, accuses a black man of rape and attempted murder. The NAACP believes the man, Joseph Spell, is innocent and sends Marshall to defend him. Marshall enlists local lawyer Sam Friedman (Josh Gad) whose previous track record involves tax or insurance cases. Friedman worries about his family's safety due to the unrest the controversial trial causes. Sam and Thurgood must work together to defend Spell\\\\x85and each other.This film is very good and so is its screenplay. The touches of comedy bring a welcome balance to its serious topic and difficult history. There is an array of good lines for Boseman and Gad. Several other actors get a chance to shine as well. I appreciate that Marshall takes its subjects seriously, but doesn't take on a dreary tone doing it. The scenes in the courtroom are intense and keep you interested in the action. As the case develops, these scenes get more and more engaging.While Boseman is very good as Thurgood Marshall, his performance is disappointing considering how hyped his portrayal has been in the film's ad campaign. He gives Marshall a suave personality but the script limits his ability to show off his range and really take the character on a journey. On the other hand, Josh Gad is a standout as Sam Friedman. He plays to his comedic strengths as Marshall's sidekick while also giving a genuinely good dramatic performance as a central and evolved character. He is a nice foil to Boseman and their chemistry reminds me of a buddy cop comedy.The lesson I take from the film is that you have to follow your moral compass even when it's hard. Sam's unwillingness to join the case makes sense. He is just starting out and worried that it could ruin his reputation. The fact that he does it anyway is a testament to the person Friedman must have been in real life.I give Marshall an age rating of 14 to 18 because of some racial and offensive language and suggestive and violent content, including depictions of the alleged assault. And my verdict on Marshall? 4 out of 5 stars. Marshall opens in theaters on October 13, 2017 so go check it out.Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.\\\", 'An exceptional story with great achievements and with great potential that delivers short in the movie, it could be a heartbreaking drama it could be an outstanding acting film but the played it safe, the cast, the screenplay, the pace, the script was just enough to make it work, yes the film is enjoyable, but without risks, just a great story captured in a regular but enjoyable movie.', 'A powerful, engaging, sleek legal drama based on the facts .. a true story.. About one of the pioneer NAACP lawyer and his role during racial tensions .. how Thurgood Marshall was there \\\"not to extinguish fire but to be one\\\" in his words.. commendable performances by the protagonists Chadwick Boseman and Josh Gad.. a must see', \\\"You would think it would be straight forward to come up with a provocative movie set in the US when segregation was in vogue. Not so! Roger Friedman is a decendant of Sam Friedman and a film critic who wrote an interesting article criticising the many inaccuracies in this film.So, the director and writers have an easy topic to critique history. They had a great man like Thurgood Marshall and some backward social attitudes that are as backward as our attitudes toward domestic violence today. Instead, the authors fill the movie with false facts and make Marshall look like an arrogant, unrefined twit (which he was neither). The directors and writers play the race card in all the wrong ways* and throw in a few sex jibes to top off a good dose of revisionism, undermining what could have been a great movie.As others have said, Josh Gad was the better principal actor in this movie. Sterling Brown as the accused was far more nuanced and capable than Chadwick Boseman as Marshall. Boseman is charming, but a totally wrong fit.I still give it a 6/10, which is very generous given the director and writers who totally failed to capture the essence of the story. The revisionist history and significant number of factual errors cast a large shadow over what could have been a great movie.Is the truth not interesting enough? The real Marshall is an amazing man - far better than Boseman's insulting copy.* Hollywood needs to curb its political correctness. I've banned my children from watching new movies until I screen them. That's how bad Hollywood has become. I know quite a few parents who feel the same way.\\\", \\\"I was hoping it would be a movie about the life of Thurgood Marshall. Instead it was focused on one case and didn't give much insight into Marshall at all. It was a decent movie, but with the life Marshall led, this can't have been even close to the most interesting story they could have told.\\\", \\\"It's 1941. Thurgood Marshall (Chadwick Boseman) travels the country as NAACP's only lawyer crusading for black defendants against the racist justice system. His next case is in Greenwich, Connecticut where rich housewife Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson) has accused her driver Joseph Spell (Sterling K. Brown) of raping her. Insurance lawyer Sam Friedman (Josh Gad) is recruited. He's reluctant and on top of that, Judge Foster (James Cromwell) refuses to accept Marshall into the local state bar. With Marshall silenced in court and with no criminal court experience, Friedman has to battle entitled prosecutor Loren Willis (Dan Stevens).This is a biodrama of one particular case with future Supreme Court judge Marshall. The story is compelling and the history is fascinating. The actors are all first rate. The actual court case does have some awkward turns. It's a thin line between blaming the victim and searching for the truth. It may help to definitively declare Spell as innocent from the start. This shouldn't be a courtroom mystery and should skew more towards underdog courtroom drama. If Marshall gets the truth from Spell at the beginning, he would come out looking even better. There are a lot of twisting that reminds me too much of a TV courtroom drama. I do love a lot of this movie but little things keep bugging me. For example, I love the kitchen knife joke but their kiss after temple strikes me as too much. I prefer a knowing touch and a sweet smile for her husband to drive home that scene much better. None of the little issues prevent me from really enjoying this well-acted compelling historical drama.\\\", \\\"I hate to say most, but there's a lot of biopics that are very formulaic in nature. And come to think of it, every genre deals with that issue. I can acknowledge that it's immensely hard to make a film that feels fresh and relevant at the same time. But I think the reason I tend to feel this way about biopics is because a lot of them seem to be directly aimed for the Oscar audience. And while that could be the case with Marshall, it's nothing less than a delightful film to watch.As with so many biopics, the main reason Marshall succeeds is Chadwick Boseman's unsurprisingly good turn as the famous lawyer, Thurgood Marshall. Whether or not Thurgood was this way in real life, I absolutely loved the sheer display of confidence in Boseman's portrayal. It was almost to the point of cockiness, without being arrogant. It's that balance that made me appreciate what this man brought to the table.Of course, there's also the dynamic of having a story that is still relevant to this day. Not only are people of color still discriminated, underestimated, and not believed in the court of law, but the idea of pitting race against race in the courtroom is something that is still unfortunately an issue today. So in a way, it was disheartening to watch the injustices happening throughout Marshall, as we know they are far from being over in the 1940's, but it's always nice to see something stick up for their people no matter what time period they are from.Boseman isn't the only one who gives a good performance as Josh Gad, Sterling K. Brown, Kate Hudson, James Cromwell, and a few others give valuable turns as their respected characters. I think my only issue with the film is that it ultimately felt very safe. I'm not one to know how these real life cases played out, but Marshall definitely feels like it took a guarded approach to the subject matter. Because of that, you can appeal to a mass audience, but I don't know that it was as detailed or thorough that it needed to be. Don't get me wrong, Marshall is a powerful film, but I think it could have taken an even further step forward into that realm.8.2/10\\\", \\\"Marshall\\\\nDirected by Reginald Hudlin. Written by Michael Koskoff and Jacob KoskoffI watch a variety of films. I like horror and thrillers but at the same time can enjoy a historical drama as well. This movie falls into that category. Marshall stars Chadwick Boseman(Black Panther) as Thurgood Marshall as he travels to Bridgeport, Connecticut to help a black man accused of raping a well to do woman. He is not allowed to participate in the court proceedings so his proxy is Josh Gad who is not a criminal defense attorney. This is all based on a true story. So it has that going for it.This is a perfect example of a fine movie. A fine movie is enjoyable. A fine movie has quality performances throughout. A fine movie tells a story that you can follow and you might even be invested in but a fine movie doesn't do more than that. This is an important story. It tells how Marshall has this last trial to get the NAACP going in respect to civil rights progress.It does all of this just fine. It just never engages more than that. It hits all the spots that it is supposed to hit when it comes to this kind of story. I hate trying to talk about movies like this. There is little to say because the movie tells it's courtroom drama adequately enough. It doesn't present with too much visual flair because the story is the most important aspect. I think it could have done with some melodramatics and some out there visual flair. It might have engaged with the pictures more than just the beat by beat it gives you.I realize that I've not said anything about Black Panther himself. He's alright. He doesn't look a thing like Thurgood Marshall but that's not a big thing in this case. Sometimes it can be off putting. Sometimes it can be at the expense of who the character is internally. This does that somewhat. The case is the focal point.I give this movie a C.\\\", 'A look at the career of Thurgood Marshall. Maybe more people will know who he is and what exactly he accomplished.Kudos entire cast was riveting!', 'Packed house last night at the AMC Lincoln Center Theater for the NY Times Film Club premiere, a crowd of old white presumably liberal folk with a noticeably Jewish vibe. What you\\\\'d expect from the Times Film Club, I suppose, but the absence of black faces was very strange, and put the whole experience out of kilter for me. The film seems aimed at a much younger and blacker audience. When, at the beginning of the film, Boseman offhandedly ordered Gad to carry his bags, and Gad complied immediately, the lone outburst of \\\"Whoa!\\\" fell into almost total (shocked?) silence. That set the tone for me. Marshall is flat-out superhero here, the master bringing sidekick Friedman rapidly up to speed on the state of the Real World. That Waking Up Friedman subplot runs in and out of the main courtroom rape drama, where Sterling K Brown and Kate Hudson nearly steal the show with their far more realistic turns as Spell and Strubing, and James Cromwell and Dan Stevens are skin-crawlingly detestable as judge and prosecutor stooping ever lower to defend the racist ivory tower of Bridgeport CT. How this will do immediately at the box office depends on a lot of other factors, including the trailers. But my guess is that the inherent value of the story, which couldn\\\\'t be more timely, will connect with audiences on a deep level, while the shenanigans on the surface keep them entertained, and the in the end they\\\\'ll put it together in their own way. I expect this will be a keeper, something that will be on TV and video for a long, long time, and that \\\"Marshall\\\" will enter the rap lexicon on several levels very quickly.', \\\"'MARSHALL': Four Stars (Out of Five)A courtroom drama/biopic about the first African-American Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall, and one of his first big cases. The movie stars Chadwick Boseman as Marshall, and it was directed by Reginald Hudlin (some fun trivia, Hudlin wrote the Marvel comic book 'Black Panther', from 2005 to 2008, and Boseman is now playing the character in the Marvel Studios movies). The screenplay was written by Michael and Jacob Koskoff. Josh Gad, Kate Hudson, Sterling K. Brown, Dan Stevens and James Cromwell all costar in the legal drama. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I enjoyed it.The story takes place in 1940 Bridgeport Connecticut. It revolves around Thurgood Marshall (Boseman), an NAACP lawyer who was traveling around the country defending people wrongly accused of crimes due to their color. He's sent to Connecticut to defend a chauffer, named Joseph Spell (Brown), who was accused of raping his employer, a white woman named Eleanor Strubing (Hudson). An insurance lawyer, named Sam Friedman (Gad), attempts to get Marshall admitted to the local bar, but the judge (Cromwell) refuses to allow him tospeak during the trial. So Friedman is forced to become Spell's lead counsel, with Marshall assisting him through notes and whispers. \\\\n \\\\nThe movie is a pretty routine courtroom drama, but it's much more involving because of it's social commentary (on the racism of that time). It's got a great cast, especially Boseman in the lead, who makes a very powerful and charismatic leading man. The film is involving, and aptly directed, but it's also mostly predictable. It's still a lot of fun to watch though, and movies about racial injustice are always important.\\\", \\\"As always, when I watch a movie based on real events, I try to compare to what really happened and I usually end up not liking the movie that much because of this. With this one I think they did an excellent job with the case, being pretty faithful to what really happened, with some details changed, but most of it is pretty accurate. Chadwick Boseman turns up another excellent performance as the titular Thurgood Marshall. The production design is impeccable and the courtroom scenes very engaging. So everything seems fine with this movie, with one notable exception, Sam Friedman, here played by Josh Gad. Everything about him is wrong and a total disrespect for the man. This case was mostly won by him with very little help from Marshall, which begs the question, if you wanted to make a movie about Thurgood Marshall why choose a case in which he didn't have that big of an impact, and change everything to make it look like he did? Why not make a movie about his most famous cases? I really can't answer this questions and it casts a giant shadow over the movie.\\\", 'Marshall appeared to be written to the audience of people who probably did not know very much about the early NAACP, or Thurgood Marshall in general. The movie did not captivate his pinnacle case \\\"Brown vs Board of Education Topeka\\\" or his ascension to the Supreme Court. The movie did not highlight any of his 32 cases before the United States Supreme Court. This movie was an introductory that raises one\\\\'s interest in the subject of this man, his contributions to civil rights, and obstacles that faced African Americans during this period of United States History.I would recommend this movie to people who are very knowledgeable of Justice Marshall, or perhaps not fully aware of the ramifications of his life\\\\'s work. Perhaps millennial, like myself, who cannot fully appreciate the journey and progress of civil rights, were the target audience of this movie.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and think it is currently undervalued. The actor who played Justice Marshall was great, the actor who played Mr. Friedman was excellent as well. I would also like to give a shoutout to the way the movie portrayed the residing judge of this case, because he was a very significant character and his transitions in the movie truly gave the movie a climactic moment that really resonated with me. I would recommend Marshall to any of my friends and thought it was great.', 'This film tells the story of a African American lawyer, who fights against social Injustice by helping people who are charged with crimes because of their skin color.\\\"Marshall\\\" tells a compelling story of the fight for the right and just. The story is gripping because it is not an easy fight. Indeed, the African American characters evoke much sympathy and really connects with the viewers. I enjoyed it a lot.', 'It is set in Greenwich, Connecticut, in 1941 and is \\\"based on\\\" one of Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall\\\\'s early civil rights cases when he was a practicing lawyer.Thurgood Marshall (Chadwick Boseman) is a young NAACP staff lawyer sent to Greenwich, Connecticut, to defend Joseph Spell (Sterling K. Brown) against the charge of raping and attempting to kill his white employer, Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson). He was said to have raped her, then bound her, and thrown her off a bridge. However, she managed to swim to shore and then reported the rape. Since Marshall came from out-of-state, he needed a local lawyer to be part of the case. Sam Friedman (Josh Gad) was a Jewish lawyer who only handled civil, not criminal, cases. He was initially reluctant to take the case. The movie depicts Judge Foster (James Cromwell) as biased and the prosecutor, Loris Willis) as an Ivy League snob. The Judge allows Marshall to sit the second chair but not to make arguments or question witnesses, so Marshall coaches Friedman throughout the trial.The movie then details the trial with flashbacks to illustrate Eleanor Strubing\\\\'s story and later illustrates Joseph Spell\\\\'s claim that the sex was consensual, that he had initially approached her for money, and that she had invited the sex. He said that Strubing only panicked after the fact and jumped off the bridge of her own volition. Friedman manages to raise doubt based on gaps and contradictions in Strubing\\\\'s story, and the jury ultimately finds Spell not guilty.This was quite a famous trial when it took place in early 1941. It was a front-page story in the New York Times when the incident happened (the story is in the December 12, 1940 issue of the Times.). Contrary to the film, Sam Friedman and Thurgood Marshall were much more equal than portrayed in the film. Friedman was a bit older and already had a reputation for theatrical performance in courts. He had been hired by the NAACP before Marshall got to town. Indeed, Friedman did act as the lead defense lawyer in the trial. Again contrary to the film, Joseph Spell had admitted from the beginning that he had sex with Eleanor Strubing but always insisted it was consensual. Strubing\\\\'s contradictory story included a ransom note that was never found and a rope said to have bound her hands that were never found. There were actual doubts about her story from the beginning. Nonetheless, it was a remarkable success story for the NAACP.This is an interesting film. The relationship between Marshall and Friedman includes humor and Friedman\\\\'s sensibilities arising from his own Jewish background. Chadwick Boseman is excellent as a self-confident black lawyer. Josh Gad is a good complement to the Marshall character.', \\\"Leaving aside the civil justice warrior biography template that's slightly overdone in Hollywood - this film works on every other front. The acting is exceptional, the script and storylines well selected.For a biography, enough shades of grey though there could have been more, the story is an important one. The direction and editing also deserves a mention. The character of Sam is very well created/portrayed and despite the high brow thrill of courtroom drama, it brings home truths and lies close to reality.If not for anything, it is a story of America, its history and its values told from the perspective of one phenomenal man's fight along the way. Watch it for the story if not anything else!\\\", 'Before he played the lead in Marvel Studios\\\\' superhero sage \\\"Black Panther,\\\" actor Chadwick Boseman played a genuine African-American hero in \\\"Boomerang\\\" director Reginald Hudlin\\\\'s \\\"Marshall,\\\" a sterling biographical courtroom yarn about civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall. As it turns out, this is the same individual who argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court and then later donned the robes as the first African-American to sit on the highest federal court of the United States. It doesn\\\\'t hurt matters that seasoned civil rights advocate Michael Koskoff and his son Jacob penned the screenplay. Interestingly, the elder Koskoff still serves as an attorney in Connecticut, where the trial took place in 1941, so he would know something about the hurdles that Marshall had to negotiate. At this point in his life, Marshall worked as the sole legal counsel for the NAACP, and his NAACP superior Walter White (Roger Guenveur Smith of \\\"Eve\\\\'s Bayou\\\") dispatches him to all parts of the country to defend poor African-Americans who cannot afford an attorney.\\\"Marshall\\\" depicts the title character as a sharp, savvy, sartorially elegant attorney who refused to be intimidated by anybody. Boseman has a field day incarnating this historical personage. Neither Hudlin nor the Koskoffs reveal a great deal about Thurgood Marshall beyond his dedication to the rights of African-Americans in a legal system skewered against them. Indeed, we do learn about the problems that Marshall and his wife Vivien \\\"Buster\\\" Burey (Keesha Sharp of \\\"Malibu\\\\'s Most Wanted\\\") encountered in their repeated but futile efforts to get pregnant. Eventually, she does have a baby. Nevertheless, Hudlin and the Koskoffs don\\\\'t let Marshall\\\\'s own life history interfere with the trial at hand. Mind you, \\\"Marshall\\\" clocks in two minutes short of two hours, but Hudlin doesn\\\\'t malinger. The trial in question takes place in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The authorities have arrested a middle-aged, African-American chauffeur, Joseph Spell (Sterling K. Brown of \\\"Brown Sugar\\\"), for allegedly raping a Greenwich socialite, Mrs. Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson of \\\"Deepwater Horizon\\\"), and then throwing her into a reservoir late one evening. According to Koskoff, when the press broke the story, one newspaper touted it as \\\"the sex trial of the century.\\\" When Marshall visits Spell in his jail cell, the attorney explains that the NAACP represents only innocent blacks. Spell assures Marshall that he did not rape Strubing. Furthermore, he has an alibi for his whereabouts when the crime occurred, and the witness in question turns out to be a white policeman who is prepared to testify.As the case unfolds, Marshall realizes that he lacks the appropriate credentials to practice law in Connecticut, so he finds a gullible but willing Jewish insurance attorney, Sam Friedman (Josh Gad of \\\"Pixels\\\"), to help him represent Spell. Friedman constantly has second thoughts about the trial and the dire publicity that may irreparably damage his budding civil practice. Nevertheless, he agrees to serve as Spell\\\\'s mouthpiece. Meantime, the abrasive Judge Foster (James Cromwell of \\\"L.A. Confidential\\\") refuses to let Marshall utter a syllable during the trial and threatens to hold him in contempt if he does. Throughout the trial, Marshall must coach Friedman because the latter hasn\\\\'t argued a criminal case. If these two strikes against our sympathetic, but snappy hero aren\\\\'t enough, Marshall discovers about half-way through the case that Spell has been lying to them. Indeed, Spell didn\\\\'t rape Strubing! Instead, he had intimate consensual relations with her, because her abusive, bad-tempered husband, John Strubing (Jeremy Bobb of \\\"Boy Wonder\\\"), often left her alone at night. Naturally, Friedman struggles to improvise, but he falls into too many traps laid by prosecuting attorney Loren Willis (Dan Stevens of \\\"The Guest\\\"), who is supremely confident that he will win a conviction. Of course, the good citizens of Bridgeport aren\\\\'t happy with both Marshall and Friedman, and they go after them with fists.

Reviews: \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\t1. I went into this movie having no clue what it was about and wasn't expecting much, but I loved it.There are innumerable movies with huge budgets that simply fall flat, and Upgrade, with a Budget of around $5,000,000, which doesn't cover the cost of catering on some of these huge budgeted flops, honestly looked like it cost a lot more than it actually did.Intelligent script, good action, very few unnecessary scenes, and though I thought it was sure to let me down, a very good ending.And although I have seen much of Logan Marshall-Green's work and was never a huge fan, he does a very good job here.Recommended.\\n\\t2. I'll give this film credit for putting a fresh spin on the overdone revenge film. The action is very unique, while also evoking memories of the Wachowskis' work on The Matrix. I really enjoyed the Vangelis-esque score used throughout. It helped create that dark, futuristic atmosphere necessary for the story. Even if you think you see where the story is going, it manages to go in unexpected directions. Between the cool concept, great sets, and dark themes, Upgrade is just that, an upgrade to the typical revenge action thriller.\\n\\t3. Through and through this movie felt like a longer episode of black mirror. The production was higher and the cinematography was really cool. I could see how the stabilization lock on his head during fight scenes could make some people dizzy, but I thought it was a unique way of doing things. Some of the acting was sub-par during the casual interactions, but I thought the plot and action made up for it. It's thought provoking in the way Black Mirror is and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys that content and doesn't mind gore.\\n\\t4. This has seriously become my favorite AI movie to date. I can't believe it was low budget because it's impossible to tell apart from the unknown actors who all do an excellent job. I will do my best to replace its lack of marketing with recommeding it to everyone. I was expecting something entertaining and instead got an amazing plot with a mind-blowing ending. If you enjoy this genre, you can't let this one pass you by. What everyone says is true, it's like a long, perfectly executed Black Mirror episode. I rated it 10 stars for the simple reason that I could not fine anything wrong with it or anything I didn't like. From beginning to end, this movie is amazing. I cannot recommend it enough.\\n\\t5. Brilliant.This movie is proof that you don't need all the special effects in the world to make an amazing sci fi movie. This is low budget done right (think Ex Machina).I signed up to IMDB to review this movie, I was that impressed. I see tons of people making that remark about films but honestly, this movie is unbelievable and for any sci fi fan out there, you need to watch this.I went in blind, no trailer, no knowledge of the movie what so ever and I would advise you do the same.The plot is simple, it's a revenge story that's been done countless times, yet it feels so fresh, acting Is slightly suspect throughout the first 10-15 minutes but the story will grip you, be patient.Honestly, I don't want to give anything away so just watch this movie.9.5/10Easily my favourite sci fi for a LONG time.Enjoy.\\n\\t6. Upgrade is unfortunately in the club of great movies that completely flew under the radar when first released. But that might actually work to its advantage, as this is definitely one of those movies where the less you know going in, the better. The only reason I was aware of Upgrade is because of writer/director Leigh Whannell (Saw, Insidious), and the fact I'd heard plenty of great things from friends who'd seen it. The film takes the all-too-familiar premise of a man looking to avenge the murder of his wife, and puts an interesting new sci-fi spin on it. Whannell clearly loves the classics, because Upgrade's influences are easy to spot - RoboCop, Blade Runner, Dredd, Death Wish. They've all been thrown in a blender, and what comes out is something that feels like its own movie, while also paying tribute to everything that inspired Whannell to become a filmmaker in the first place. Upgrade is violent, thought-provoking, funny, surprising, with some terrific fight sequences, an awesome soundtrack, and a dynamite performance from Logan Marshall-Green. I also get the feeling I'm gonna love it even more the next time I watch it. Highly recommended for fans of sci-fi/action.\\n\\t7. Probably worthy of a bigger production as it's a great science fiction story with comedy action and a few twists.One of those pleasant surprises that you don't expect in an unknown film, I've seen far worse more well known and promoted movies, worth a view.\\n\\t8. This film is basically \\\"Robocop\\\" meets \\\"Death Wish\\\", with less satire than the former and more humor than the latter. And it's a B movie blast. An unrelenting pace, fantastic fight choreography that doesn't skimp on the gleeful blood and gore, and never not fun or interesting to look at.Yeah some of the one-liner dialogue as delivered by Logan Marshall-Green feels a bit forced and the plot isn't exactly clever or unique, but damn it, it all works and it makes it's own beautiful alchemy out of a bunch of borrowed parts. This is cheap genre filmmaking done right.\\n\\t9. I admit to enjoying UPGRADE, a simple science fiction-oriented twist on the usual revenge storyline. I'll say straight away that the plot is nothing special and has been done plenty of times before; it's the use of familiar but new technology that makes this interesting. The identity of the villains and the supporting characters are quite perfunctory, but the direction is inventive and the film particularly shines in the action scenes, so much so that you wish there were more of them. The main actor commits to his part quite neatly and there are enough decent set-pieces to make this an enjoyable watch, more so than plenty of bigger-budgeted fare.\\n\\t10. After watching this movie you will realize how bad every other major sci-fi has been in the past several years. This is a film with an excellent story, great cast, direction is on point, and the sci-fi is well developed. The gore is in your face ;) but it adds style to the movie and depth to the plot which one realizes later in the movie.A classic to remember. Look forward to seeing this again.\\n\\t11. This movie has a plot that we have already seen in many movies, it's a mix between \\\"Robocop\\\" and \\\"The Crow\\\", so let's say that something was very predictable except for the ending that in my opinion was unexpected. One thing I really appreciated were the fight scenes that use a very particular camera movement that gave the right power and importance to the blows, scenes shot really well. I loved the performances of everyone, especially Benedict Hardie and Logan Marshall-Green. Highly recommended film, it may not be the most original thing in the world but it has its strengths.\\n\\t12. \\\"Upgrade\\\" (R, 1:35) is an action horror sci-fi comedy written and directed by Leigh Whannell, writer of the \\\"Insidious\\\" movies, the early \\\"Saw\\\" films, plus \\\"Dead Silence\\\", and director of \\\"Insidious: Chapter 3\\\". This movie was shot in Australia and Whannell and most of his cast are Australian. However, with the accents and the sets, you wouldn't know the movie wasn't American - and with the (lack of) quality in the last two \\\"Insidious\\\" movies, you wouldn't guess that Whannell was behind this gem of a film.Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green, looking a lot like Tom Hardy) is an \\\"old school\\\" auto mechanic in a near future where intelligent, driverless cars are increasingly commonplace. He's married to Asha (Melanie Vallejo), an employee at a high-tech company. They live in a house that's suitably high-tech as well, operating with voice commands and equipped with a powerful computer embedded in a table top. They're very happy... until one night when they're on their way back from meeting one of Grey's clients, a reclusive computer genius named Eron Keen (Harrison Gilbertson). Their car crashes and they get mugged. Asha is killed and Grey is paralyzed from the neck down, with only his mother to care for him.Eron visits Grey and offers him the opportunity to regain control of his body, with the help of a neck implant called Stem. The surgery succeeds spectacularly, Grey signs a non-disclosure agreement and heads home, promising that, at least for now, it appears to the world that he's still a quadriplegic. Grey quickly learns that Stem can talk to him (as voiced by Simon Maiden). Given the lack of progress by a police investigator named Cortez (Betty Gabriel), Grey takes advantage of Stem's Alexa-on-steroids capabilities to find the men who killed his wife. Normally not a violent man, Grey finds himself overmatched by these men, who themselves are technologically enhanced, until he learns how Stem can also help him fight. But, alas, avenging his wife's death isn't as satisfying as Grey might've expected.\\\"Upgrade\\\" is a very appropriate title, given some of the writer-director's mediocre movies - and as a comparison to other films in the AI subgenre. This one is a combination of \\\"Deadpool\\\", \\\"Ex Machina\\\", \\\"Transcendence\\\" and the \\\"Bourne\\\" movies, but still feels fresh and creative, visually and narratively. The occasional comedy comes from the combination of Grey adjusting to having Stem's cells in his brain and some gallows humor as he pursues his wife's killers. The film also features one of the best recent casts you never heard of. The high-quality cinematography, editing, acting, pacing, directing and screenplay (with some late-game twists) makes this one of the most balanced and entertaining movies of 2018. \\\"A\\\"\\n\\t13. I guess you can call this a B-movie, but that's not always a bad thing, and certainly not in this case.It has it's moments and some originality, which is rare in todays Hollywood remake factory.As for the B-movie thing it's worth mentioning the actor(s). The main actor had a little... uhm... stiff delivery.It doesn't hurt the movie in any way, it's a nice use of your time, and I will most likely watch it again.\\n\\t14. 'Upgrade' takes up many familiar dystopian sci-fi tropes and fuses them into a generic revenge-action movie. And if you came for the action there is a good change you will like this film. The fighting scenes, involving a combination of (slightly overpowered) superhero physics and grindhouse-like violence, certainly look spectacular, especially considering the low budget. However, if you, like me, came for thought-provoking sci-fi you will probably be disappointed. It's not that it totally lacks great ideas, on the contrary. By touching on too many interesting topics (humanity's increasing dependency on technology, governments and companies experimenting on humans, and, of course, the rise of Artificial Intelligence) you could even argue that the makers bit off more than they could chew. What remains is a cyberpunk action flick that never really goes into depth.The same can also be said of its main characters, all of which seem to lack any emotional complexity. Even the non-enhanced humans in the story often seem to act robotlike. This especially applies to Eron, but also to Grey, who, even though he is supposed to represent humanity in a world dominated by technology, is practically emotionless throughout the entire movie. The underlying problem here seems to be the pace of the film. With a first act taking up no more than ten minutes, the film takes absolutely no time to develop the main characters beyond the archetypes of the \\\"stubborn technophobe\\\", \\\"brilliant but anti-social inventor\\\", and the \\\"happy-go-lucky wife\\\". Not to mention the machine-hybrid cliche supervillain, who is especially hard to take seriously. The limited time you get to spend with these characters makes it even harder to genuinely feel for them as the story unfolds.The film, however, does succeed in bringing to life a dark, grim and empty world that feels painfully familiar and realistic - a sheer contrast with the characters that inhabit it. A scene, for example, that clearly stood out for me was the one with VR-junkies in the worn-out apartment building; it beautifully captured the blurred lines between the \\\"real\\\" and the \\\"fake\\\" that we increasingly seem to experience in everyday life. But even during these rare brilliant moments, the film felt rushed and overshadowed by action sequences. Admittedly, the ending was pretty surprising, but this could hardly compensate for structural flaws of the film. All in all, I found it an unfulfilling experience.\\n\\t15. What an unexpectedly brilliant movie. Lots of laughs, some moments that I almost couldn't look, fabulously different story line, last minute surprise ending, car chases, and brilliant fight scenes.\\n\\t16. I think that many of the reviews below have already summed this movie up quite well. It's a standard revenge movie, but with a sci-fi twist and some incredibly impressive fight scenes. It's well-paced, well-acted, has a solid script, and the plot is more interesting and complicated than you might think from seeing the trailers alone.One other thing I really liked about it was the director's vision of the near future. With a few little exceptions (like how a computer chip in your neck can make you defy physics and stand up without bending any limb) the world here is very believable and depicted in such a way that was visually appealing without going too far as to make it look too flashy to be realistic.Don't let the fact that this was made by someone who directed one of the Insidious movies bother you either. This is wayyyyyy better than any of those movies. Director/writer Leigh Whannell has really found his footing here and delivered a movie that's highly entertaining and doesn't pull any punches.\\n\\t17. Upgrade is a straight-forward, entertaining violent action film about our potential near-future, and it's not all that pretty. This movie is just like a Black Mirror episode, a modernistic yet pessimistic view of how technology is evolving. Some are for it, others are not. The anti-technology theme here is quite clear: Asimov may have been right.First, what did Upgrade do right? Well it's certainly intense, with some really sweet fight scenes and unique choreography. The camera work was fun too. It's an engaging story, good acting, overall a fantastic movie if you love sci-fi and violence.However, there were some issues. For one, the fight scenes were disappointingly few and far in between. I may have been misled by other reviews, but do not go in expecting something like \\\"The Raid\\\" movies. Some plot holes were spotted, and on a personal level, I do not go looking for those while enjoying a movie. Additionally, the plot holes were as obvious as the plot was predictable. So don't expect any ground-breaking story here.But its intentions weren't to grab an Oscar in Best Original Script, or any Oscar for that matter. Its intents were evidently to entertain those who just wanted a great sci-fi action thriller without having to think too much, and to warn us of possible dangers lurking behind the excitement of the modern evolution of technology. So, I guess enjoy the movie, but be cautious of that thing on your kitchen counter that tells you the weather and controls the lights.\\n\\t18. As stories go, Upgrade isn't anything particularly spectacular. There's some really good ideas of course, but the idea of cyborgs and AI taking over humanity are as old as technology itself. It also surprisingly draws parallels to a superhero movie released in the same year; Venom, where a normal Tom Hardy-looking guy finds himself possessed by an entity that helps him get what he wants by controlling his body. Where Upgrade really shines is in its execution. The build-up leading to multiple multi-layered twists upon each other lend the film an unpredictable narrative complexity, where multiple rewatches are guaranteed to illuminate more subtle complexities, callbacks, and foreshadowing.Something that really makes Upgrade stand out is Logan Marshall-Green, who offers a truly impressive physical performance that is both demanding and complicated to achieve. The controlling of his body by an AI leads to some stylish fight choreography, and Marshall-Green doesn't stutter in adding robotic, calculated movements to those scenes, while simultaneously acting in juxtaposition with his head and facial expressions. He's confused and bewildered while he slices a guy up with a kitchen knife, he brags and gloats while his body effortlessly dispatches of goons, he pleads with bad guys not to continue fighting while his robotic-moving arms quickly and decisively disarm and dispatch of them. He holds such an impressive disconnect between his head and his body that I couldn't even imagine how hard it must have been to develop such physical coordination while acting and making it look effortless at the same time. Marshall-Green has never particularly impressed me before, but he has now.Even further though are clever uses of cameras adding another dimension to the film's visual identity. The high points are, again, the fight scenes, where the camera is just as involved in the choreography as the actors and stuntmen are. To add an even greater emphasis on the disconnect between Grey's mind and his body, the camera often keeps him fixed in frame while the settings around him movie. He's just enjoying the ride while his body does the moving, and we're put in that mindset. The way they did it is mount the camera in a rotating frame, hide a phone on Marshall-Green's body, and get them to match orientation. When Marshall-Green moves, the camera moves with him. This becomes especially impressive when Grey ducks and dives, or does full-on back-flips, and the camera mirrors his movements perfectly.Beyond that, the cinematography goes a long way to make this low-budget movie look much more expensive. Lighting is dim and harsh, camera angles are conservative yet stylish, and the CGI is used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary, which has a knock-on effect of grounding an otherwise futuristic world without getting too lofty. The score by Jed Palmer is also fantastic. I was maybe a little disappointed that Whannell didn't go for a Saw-esque climatic track for the third-act revelations, but nonetheless the score is evocative of sci-fi movies of the 70s and 80s, with borderline synthwave tracks interspersed amongst more ambient sounds.Upgrade is a solid sci-fi flick that manages to be refreshing and unique despite its otherwise overdone story elements. It ended up being a better Venom movie than Venom. All it took was an imaginative filmmaker like Leigh Whannell. I honestly can't wait to see what he manages to do next. I give Upgrade a solid 8/10.\\n\\t19. 'Upgrade' is a hybrid action/comedy/horror flick written and directed by Leigh Whannell, who previously brought us the highly successful 'Saw' and 'Insidious' franchises.It stars Logan Marshall-Green, who shall forever be known as Tom Hardy's doppelganger (seriously--compare photos), opposite Betty Gabriel, a rising star famous for her turn in the breakout hit 'Get Out.'While the acting and overall concept are both quite remarkable, there's an unmistakable clunkiness to the film, alternating between the dialogue, blocking, and editing.However, the cinematography is superb, especially on such a low budget, and the action sequences when the bio-mechanical aspect of the film are fully utilized simply aren't to be missed.\\n\\t20. I went into this with fairly low expectations. The trailer looked good, and the cinematography looked exciting. But the premise seemed tired and worn.*in a deep, movie-voice over voice* some guys kill his wife, and now he's seeking revenge\\\".But this film surpassed my expectations, and was a well-worth experience. Not only was I correct about the cinematography being exciting and engaging, but the plot actually strung together compelling way. This film came out of nowhere for me, and now, it's a memorable film that accomplishes the most important goal of any great film: gets the audience to keep wondering about it.Since I don't want to go into spoilers, I'll say one last thing: pay attention to the Foley artist's work. The sound design is poignant and additive to the experience. It reminds me of the clever usage of music from Baby Driver. Nothing is wasted and is always enriching of the world building. With Baby Driver, the music was giving us Baby's personal experience. Here, the sound effects give us Grey's point of view. Didn't experiences, but both are elevated through sound, masterfully.I genuinely want to see it again. If the trailer interested you at all, go see it. It's worth your while.\\n\\t21. Not a lot of buzz was made about this film which kind of landed in theaters with no hype. I saw one trailer at some point and knew I wanted to check it out. Logan Marshall-Green isn't exactly someone who is a leading man. Ryan Atwood's brother and a role in Prometheus are his most notable roles. So it was nice to see him as a lead, and a lesser known cast in this film. Overall, I felt the plot can be tweaked at some points but its a fun film.The film is about a man named Grey, who becomes paraplegic after he and his wife were attacked by a group of hitmen. He is approached by a tech innovator who puts a device in his body which allows him to walk and control his limbs again.. in a way. The device is actually a smart system called STEM and sometimes STEM is allowed to take over, especially when Grey is in danger. Grey uses this newfound ability to track down the men who killed his wife.Insidious: Chapter 3 wasn't overly memorable for me so I feel like this film is where Leigh Whannell puts a stamp on his film making style. The action scenes are excellent when they come. The chase and combat on screen are stellar. The film does well to use its futuristic setting to set a landscape for the film, which itself still feels modern. The film also has humor at the right times. Its not overbearing but when it comes it feels right.My main concerns with the film was the underdeveloped side characters and there's a bit of convenience when need be. The plot feels like it could have been worked in a less cloudy manner but its not a major detraction from the rest of the effort. Its a surprisingly different effort. We've seen this type of film before but the film still seems to remain fresh and fun. Not really a title people are going to talk about this year but its good fun and that's good enough.7/10\\n\\t22. Really enjoyed this movie. A very good dose of future technology and where it would lead us to. We are already seeing the birth of some of the concepts shown in this movie and like with any technology there will be good usage and bad.\\nI dont understand the bad comments on violence as it is \\\"indirect\\\" (without giving away).\\nFast paced and suspenseful. Logan Marshall-Green acted well without any \\\"overacting\\\" or showing off. Screen play and direction were very good. It is original concept and I did not see any connection with Death wish or other movies - not even close or people did not understand the movie?\\n\\t23. Upgrade greatly exceeded my expectations: truly entertaining, and remarkably well produced. Great acting by the lead character. Stylistically speaking, it's perfect: very good cinematography, amazing fight choreography, beautiful scenography and music, perfect CGI, and the overall \\\"feel\\\" of the atmosphere. Only 5 millions were spent. Often, you will not find that attention for scenography and CGI in Hollywood productions.\\nIn the end, it's a little nice movie with a standard plot that nonetheless got me hooked: it got more and more entertaining, and then some more. There are many cliches, but that's a plus: when the director is good, having a cliche smoothly inserted into the story is pure fun. Each of the main events has a reason to be and a nice explanation (sometimes, it's quite original), so that the story never really feels that \\\"standard\\\".\\nThere are just a couple of minor holes here and there, but nothing like what you will read in some reviews: infact, the structure is perfectly logic, and if part of the audience doesn't pay attention, that's not movie's fault.Ps: forgot to mention... I realized I never saw a movie depicting cyber-bio-implants or whatever. Blade Runner does not, Ex-Machina does not, Strange days does not. This movie finally does.\\n\\t24. If you wanted to see \\\"Venom\\\" but didn't want to be distracted by all of the high end special effects and quality acting from Tom Hardy then \\\"Upgrade\\\" is the movie for you\\nLogan Marshall Green puts in a brilliant \\\"I'm not Tom Hardy\\\" performance. His inner dialogue with Kit from \\\"Knight Rider\\\" is beyond reproach.\\nTwo thumbs!\\n\\t25. After ten minutes I came close to switching it off, as I couldn't get into it, it felt as though they were spending too much time showing off future technology, however I stuck with it, and was glad I did, as it develops it really does open up, it became a wonderfully gripping and entertaining sci fi thriller. Very well acted throughout, a pretty original story, and lots of action scenes.The accident really does change the movie up, and the tone, it really is well worth a look, the ending may come as a surprise for some.Very good, 8/10.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Instructions:\\n  1.

Reviews: \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\t1. I love Shakespeare, but I've also always had a soft spot for Ophelia. This reimagining of Hamlet is not faithful to the original text, so have an open mind and you may enjoy it. I don't generally like movies that apply modern sensibilities to classic stories and characters, but this one was tolerable. The acting was fine, the sets and costumes beautiful. Overall it was a fine film. But if you're a purist, don't bother.\\n\\t2. I don't understand why the reviews for this one are so bad. I found this movie quite enjoyable. The acting seemed fine to me and the scenery and costume designs were really lovely. I enjoyed watching this movie a lot. I suppose those looking for the traditional portrayal of Hamlet might be disappointed. I enjoyed the updated dialogue and storyline from Ophelia's point of view. Give it a chance - you'll likely be pleased you did.\\n\\t3. Hard to believe the hostility directed against this movie.\\nIt's not Hamlet, but another take on the story from the viewpoint of Ophelia. The director chose to show the protagonist as a strong women.\\nEnjoyed the character development and the storyline. Directing was solid. All the actors were quite believable in their roles.\\n\\t4. I watched this because I wanted to see what Daisy Ridley's acting was like outside of Star Wars. I had seen her in Murder on the Orient Express, but her role was relatively small in that. This film isn't incredibly exciting, but Ridley certainly gives a fine performance as a fleshed-out Ophelia. The other actors carry themselves well, in addition; and the period sets, costumes, and locations are convincing.\\n\\t5. This was enjoyable in my opinion. I've seen Hamlet. I've read the play. This is not an exact remake of the original work but I liked that it was a reimagining.In this film, Ophelia is our main character and we seen how things unfold from her perspective. Her role in the original work is a big deal seeing as she was the innocence in a corrupt court who was driven to insanity and then suicide after the deaths of the men she loved most. Suicide was her escape from all the revenge, evil and madness taking place around her. Here we see her much more resilient without losing her innocent nature. The basic plot of the film is still present but things don't go down the same way.I thought it was filmed well and the acting was good. I thought the concept presented was creative. I'm sure that a lot of folks will take issue and feel like it was to far removed from the original work but if you take it for what it is rather than point out all the differences, it was a good film. I say check it out.\\n\\t6. It is not surprising the name of the costume designer features so early in the credits because he played a major role in making this film so watchable. All those gorgeous costumes must have cost a bit but along with some splendid d\\u00e9cor, ecclesiastical and baronial interiors (and a few exteriors) and outdoor scenes of woods glades and hills this film never fail to offer pleasure for the eye. The story proceeds at a sufficient pace with some unexpected twists and turns while bringing out how empty and unsatisfying royal or any great power can be. Is it really worth fighting so hard for? Pity about the mayhem of the penultimate scene, it was unnecessary, but makes Ophelia's choice at the end seem a wise one.\\n\\t7. Critics seem to have difficulties agreeing on whether this is a spin-of of Hamlet to tell Ophelia's story, or simply Hamlet's story told from Ophelia's POV. I tend to side with the former.\\nOne thing definitely reimagined here is that Ophelia is no longer a helpless, passive victim eventually driven to madness. She is all courage, intelligence, wit, spirit, resourceful, and more. And why not, if she is played by Daisy Ridley whom we know best as Rey, the new heroine in the third and final trilogy of the Star Wars saga that spanned the silver screen for over 4 decades. Incidentally, in about 2 months, our patience will be rewarded with the answer to Rey's real heritage. But I digress.\\nAmong other things, this movie has a generous offer of witty word plays. Right at the start, when Ophelia as a child (Mia Quiney) is taken under the wings of Queen Gertrude (Naomi Watts), the first exchange includes the Queen's mild exclamation of \\\"Alas, indeed\\\", which is turned by the witty Ophelia into \\\"a lass\\\", as she is often mistaken for a boy in her tomboyish childhood.\\nIn the first encounter (not counting stealing glances at each other at a distance) between Ophelia and Hamlet (George MacKay), she is fully submerged in serene lake water when surprised by him and Horatio on shore. Hamlet promptly commented that as she is a lady-in-waiting, perhaps she wouldn't mind waiting a bit longer. They would not inconvenience themselves on her account with looking for another spot for fishing. Totally unruffled, Ophelia teasingly emerges from water in tantalizingly slow motion, only to have the jaw-dropping Hamlet finally discover that she is fully clothed (Horatio has already walked away in embarrassment). That is a most definitive establishing scene of Ophelia.\\nOther depiction of Ophelia includes \\\"she dances like a goat\\\" (as per the other ladies-in-waiting). B then, she is \\\"a girl that can read\\\", surprising Gertrude who immediately gets even as Ophelia finds that her bedside reading to the queen is not a book of religious devotion but passionate novels of romance.\\nIn this movie, the Shakespearean English has been modernized, exemplified in probably the best-known fatherly advice, \\\"Neither a borrower nor a lender be\\\". Here, what Polonius says to Laertes becomes \\\"Do not borrow any money or lend it\\\". Incidentally if you find the face of the actor who plays Ophelia's brother Laertes familiar, you should. This is none other than Tom Felton, otherwise better known as Draco Malfoy in Harry-Potter-verse. But I digress again.\\nFor the top-tier star presence, in addition to Ridley and Watts, there is also Clive Owen who plays the usurping uncle Claudius, most likely with more malice than you have seen anywhere else before. Note also that Watts plays not just one character, but two! Entirely new to the plot is Mechtild, a mysterious witch from whom Gertrude obtains potions for preservation of youthful looks. She also carries a secret that affects the big picture but let me not spoil it. Similarly, I will not spoil the plot which initially follows the Bard's but later throws in some twists.\\nAs mentioned in my \\\"headline\\\", this movie has aa art-house feel, but is not get overboard. The pace, for one thing, is brisk. The cinematography is first-rate, as well as costume design. There is much to enjoy, if this is your cup of tea.\\n\\t8. I didn't know what to expect but I thought it was a pretty cool movie. I don't know much about Hamlet but I was entertained. Bravo.\\n\\t9. I read the book by Lisa Klein that this is based on as a teenager. I loved it, so I might be a bit biased, but I didn't mind the changes to the Hamlet story. I thought the costumes, sets, and everything where gorgeous. The casting is good and most of the actors do the best they can with weakly written dialogue. My other TINY complaint is that they changed the ending from the book where she ends up with Horatio.Also, ignore the people who complain about having actors of different races in a medieval story. It's the 21st century. I think it's okay to cast the actor who is best for the role without getting hung up on race.\\n\\t10. \\\"Ophelia\\\" is a Drama - Romance movie in which we watch Hamlet from Ophelia's perspective. She was raised by Queen Gertrude in Elsinore Castle and she had some feelings for Prince Hamlet. Passion, romance, vengeance combined in this movie.I found this movie interesting and different since it's from a different perspective than usual. The direction which was made by Claire McCarthy was good and she presented well her main characters and the plot behind her movie. The interpretation of Daisy Ridley who played as Ophelia was good and her combination with some other actors/actresses created a good result. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Naomi Watts's who played as Gertrude / Mechtild, Clive Owen's who played as Claudius and George MacKay's who played as Hamlet. Finally, I have to say that \\\"Ophelia\\\" is an interesting movie and I recommend you to watch it just from curiosity.\\n\\t11. Never mind all the fake early ten-star reviews here--if you can't tell they're fake from the writing, click on the person's handle and you'll see that inevitably they have never posted about another movie before.This movie gets five stars for being well-produced, good-looking, professionally acted and crafted. I can't argue that it would probably entertain less discriminating (and younger) audiences, esp. if they have no prior experience with \\\"Hamlet.\\\" (God help the high school student who one day is going to figure they can skip reading the play and do a book report just from seeing this film.) But if you ARE at all familiar with \\\"Hamlet,\\\" this is is pretty ludicrous. It's not that it departs from the play in many ways; \\\"Hamlet\\\" is such a ubiquitous classic that it can certainly withstand and even welcome some imaginative, revisionist takes.(partial spoilers ahead] The probolem is that this particular take is that of a stereotypical current teenage romance-novel-slash-fantasy a la \\\"Twilight\\\" and \\\"Wicked.\\\" Poor Ophelia must of course be a spunky little rebel who only PRETENDS to go mad, won't let men tell her what to do, and other things that seem more than a bit preposterous for a young lady in a medieval Danish court. Of course Hamlet is ALL about her, in a brooding, lovesick, tormented Robert Pattinson-in-\\\"Twilight\\\" way. Things are manipulated so crazily to make O. the center of this whole story that she even sees the Ghost of Hamlet's father before he does! Because she is just that special.Gertrude is made to be bitchy and insecure, reducing Naomi Watts' performance; Clive Owen is solid as Claudius, and other performances are OK. But it's distracting that another concession to young audiences is making the court multi-ethnic, as if there were many black people around in 11th-century Denmark or whenever this is supposed to be. It's not that this is quasi-modernized, which needn't be a bad thing; it's that it's done in such a stereotypical, shallow, trendy fashion that the effect is ultimately kinda laughable.You can't say this is really a \\\"feminist\\\" take, because it's too juvenile in its approach--Ophelia may be somewhat \\\"empowered,\\\" but she's also the girl whom the Prince himself offers to \\\"walk away from it all\\\" for! She's supposed to be \\\"tough,\\\" in a sort of Katniss-in-\\\"Hunger Games\\\" way, but she also gets to be Cinderella, too. If you're getting the feeling from my description that this movie piles up way too many cliches in order to hit the target audience bull's-eye, you'd be exactly right. But jiudging from the film's reception so far, obviously you can OVERESTIMATE what your audience presumably wants, and give them so much of it that they feel condescended to. This expensive-looking movie is pretty much going straight to VOD, and that is because it is more 21st-century \\\"Gidget\\\" than \\\"Hamlet.\\\" Doing the story from Ophelia's point of view was a good idea--and someday, someone may do it right.\\n\\t12. As a huge fan of Shakespeare, I truly enjoyed this alternate take on the tale of Hamlet and Ophelia. The star-studded cast was a delight to watch deliver superb performances. The sets were absolutely breathtaking and the costuming was tasteful and evocative. The film was a rich feast of color and the music touched my heart. I found myself singing along with the theme and humming it after the end of the movie. I just love that a woman wrote the book, another the screenplay and the director was female as well. This definitely is a step in the right direction of telling \\\"herstory\\\" to take its rightful place aside \\\"history\\\".\\n\\t13. People are very harsh. Okay it's not Shakespeare- no pun intended- it's still pretty fun if not heavy on the PC stuff. Naomi Watts in two roles is always dependable. Clive Owens is a bit scary, the wig ... worth a watch if you're fan fiction kinda person.\\n\\t14. Characters act like it's happening in 21st century: winking, rolling eyes at each other, etc. Ruins the authenticity of the period of time its based in.\\n\\t15. I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. It seems to have polarized movie-goers, many \\\"1\\\" votes and many \\\"10\\\" votes. I quite like it, the movie has an interesting story and is acted and filmed very well.I have the advantage of not knowing very much at all about Shakespeare's \\\"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\\\" , the source play for the book and now the movie. As the filmmakers explain, this is a re-imagining of the basic story with more focus on Ophelia and Queen Gertrude, and what the complexity of their characters might have been. Die-hard Shakespeare fans most likely take issue, anything that changes from his various versions would likely be considered unforgivable sins.But taken as a story greatly \\\"inspired\\\" by the play, with some significant changes and trajectory for Ophelia, it works very well, at least it does for me. Not a great movie but certainly very watchable and suitably entertaining. Not a \\\"10\\\", not a \\\"1\\\", somewhere between those extremes.Daisy Ridley is really good as Ophelia, playing her as a reasonable but strong person. I don't really know much of his work but George MacKay (mac-eye) works well as Hamlet and Naomi Watts as Gertrude.\\n\\t16. There are so many expeditions into the forest and a cave that are made by Ophelia in this film that it is easy to confuse \\\"Ophelia\\\" with \\\"Dora and the Lost City of Gold\\\"!Tom Stoppard's \\\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\\\" was a play and later a film that showed Shakespeare's \\\"Hamlet\\\" from the perspectives of two schlubs who are given their fifteen minutes of fame. By contrast, \\\"Ophelia\\\" deconstructs Shakespeare's narrative not only to unfold the action from Ophelia's point of view, but it also completely reinvents the character and the narrative.In the bonus track of the DVD of \\\"Ophelia,\\\" one of the film's producers described their Ophelia as a \\\"spitfire,\\\" and within the film itself, she describes herself to us as \\\"willful.\\\" The director, Claire McCarthy, noted a \\\"tongue-in-cheek\\\" stylistic approach to the Shakespearean classic in the way that characters and events are entirely changed.Some of the most outrageous choices were have Ophelia marry Hamlet! The ceremony takes place in the forest in the style of Friar Lawrence overseeing the ceremony of Romeo and Juliet tying the knot. The quick-thinking Ophelia is also making rounds on the ramparts of Elsinore late at night on the lookout for the Ghost. Ophelia and Hamlet are both aware of that eavesdropping is occurring in a crucial scene, so they begin to whisper to each other as Claudius and Polonius are listening in. This Ophelia also does not go mad, but rather feigns the madness, giving an award-winning performance of the staged mad songs in front of the court. But the most radical change is that Ophelia stages her own death, giving the impression that she has drowned in the river!The filmmakers clearly wanted to avoid any semblance of Ophelia as a victim. In the bonus track of the DVD, McCarthy reiterated how this Ophelia was to have \\\"agency\\\" in her life. She begins as a commoner, then rises to the level of handmaiden to Queen Gertrude, prior to marrying the Prince of Denmark, and ultimately living to become a widow and proud single mom!The film was directed by a woman, and the screenplay was written by a woman, based on a woman's novel. The featured characters, Ophelia and Gertrude, were woman, and a new female character of the \\\"healer\\\" named Mechtild, is Gertrude's sister, who is always available to provide poisons, potions, and cure-alls in her cave.To crown it off, there is the convent of St. Emilion, where women who are harassed at the court may flee to safety. The protagonist will in time avail herself of the sanctuary afforded by St. Emilion. So, when Hamlet tells Ophelia, \\\"Get thee to a nunnery,\\\" he is providing the most important advice that will help to ensure victory for our Super Heroine, turning her into an Ophelia for our time!!\\n\\t17. Based on the novel by Lisa Klein, the film follows the story of Hamlet from Ophelia's perspective. The movie boasts of a talented cast, tells the story on a different and interesting point of view and has a great ending. Unfortunately it suffers from some script's problems and sometimes it isn't as gripping as it should have been.Rating: 6,5.\\n\\t18.

I just watched this for entertainment, I'm not a Shakespeare purist. Entertaining, engaging enough to hold my interest, with an interesting plot.\\n\\t20. I really don't understand why there are so many really negative reviews and positive reviews being downvoted. Is it Daisy? Is it that someone's approached Shakespeare from a new angle?I'll never find out the answer but it's a real shame.I really loved this movie. I wasn't sure on Daisy in this kind of role having only seen her in Star Wars before but I actually think she played it beautifully. I have seen someone else say they think this would have been a Kiera Knightley role ten years ago and I agree, but she would have ruined it. It needed to be understated. It needed to be timid as well as strong. None of that makes sense I suppose but in my head it does.I'm not a fan of Naomi Watts or Clive Owen but they were watchable and actually I cried for Naomi's Gertrude at the end.The costumes are gorgeous, the scenery and settings beautiful and the soundtrack is wonderful, especially the music playing over the ending scenes.It made me interested in Hamlet again.\\n\\t21. As a person who never read Shakespeares' work and is not familiar with this story, I think this movie was just okay.Pros - the production design and cinematography is kinda cool. There are some really cool shots throughout the movie & dresses, the location, they felt real.Daisy Ridley was pretty good as Ophelia, it was kinda nice to see her in something other than Star Wars.The film is overall not that bad and watchable at times, but a lot of the time I couldn't help but think it was just mid.The characters in this movie are very flat. Even though some actors tries their best and you can kinda see it, but the script doesn't explore or develop these characters that much. They didn't feel interesting other than Ophelia. (Even her character isn't that 'great', either)The film isn't a disaster but I think it could have been a LOT better.Edit: Daisy Ridley actions mad scene>>\\n\\t22. Pointless, boring, uninspired, insipid waste of time\\nalso - lol at there being Black and Asian people in the medieval Danish court\\n\\t23. I was afraid to watch this due to the fact that I have never read or seen Hamlet or anything related, and the poor reviews.\\nBut one Saturday afternoon, on a cloudy day, just finishing opening up a hot skull of a woman having increased intracranial pressure, the wife and decided, what the heck.\\nAnd so, I immensely enjoyed it. Story was engaging, Daisy as cute as ever. The banter not too dragging. No need for expositions. Naration was just enough.\\nGood movie. Watch it yourself for what it is, not what it is supposed to be (I guess).\\n\\t24. Having not read Hamlet, and being a fan of the woman's point of view, I found the actors, sceneries and story to do a great job of holding my attention. Many reviews of those who have seen Hamlet are low, but this film has now led me to begin reading Hamlet, which might change how I rate this film, but as of now, I would recommend.\\n\\t25. I'm an ultra-lefty feminist and even I eyerolled. Why couldn't it be a genuine dramatic tragedy. It didn't need this type of girl power remake.

So far I have loved every role I have seen Chadwick Boseman play, he is a great actor and has this sort of swagger when acting. Sterling K Brown is great and one of the greatest actors in recent years. It was different but enjoyable seeing Josh Gad in a drama. I wish they would make more of these movies that follow Thurgood Marshall's journey. The only negative thing is that it felt a bit long.\\n\\t2. Greetings again from the darkness. The question must be asked: is the movie worthy of the man? The man was the first attorney for the NAACP. He won 29 of the 32 cases he argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, including the ground-breaking 1954 Brown v. Board of Education (separate but equal public education). This man was a trailblazer for Civil Rights, and in 1967 became the first African- American Supreme Court Justice. This man was, of course, Thurgood Marshall \\u0085 a man who unquestionably deserves not just a movie, but a really good and important one.Chadwick Boseman has taken on film versions of such icons as Jackie Robinson in 42 and James Brown in GET ON UP, so he likely jumped at the chance to play the revered figure, Thurgood Marshall. Mr. Boseman has true movie star screen presence, and supplies the young Mr. Marshall with a self-assured swagger that accompanies a brilliant legal mind \\u2013 a mind that refused to be ignored during a time it was desperately needed. Lest he be labeled a superhero, the film does portray Marshall smoking and drinking, while also hinting at his carousing. The common flaws of a great man.It's 1941 and the young (33 years old) Marshall is the lone NAACP attorney, so he spends his time ping-ponging around the country fighting for fair trials for those African-Americans accused simply because they aren't white. He works only for \\\"innocent\\\" people and his efforts during this time were crucial to the Civil Rights movement gaining attention and legitimacy. Most of the film centers on a case in Connecticut (no, not the Jim Crow south) where a black man, Joseph Spell (Sterling K Brown), is accused of sexual assault of a \\\"respectable\\\" married white woman, Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson). If you are reminded of the great book and film TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, you must know that those literary and cinematic standards are such that few can ever hope to reach.What follows is not one of the more dramatic or tension-filled cinematic courtroom dramas. There is simply too much levity for the film to be classified as a historical heavyweight. That said, the man and his story are fascinating, and though director Reginald Hudlin chooses a deft touch rather than a sledge hammer, it's likely the wise choice if the goal is to entertain, while also educating the masses to Marshall's early career. Josh Gad co-stars as Marshall's co-counsel Sam Friedman, a specialist in legal technicalities within the insurance industry. Boseman and Gad have nice chemistry (at times it feels like a buddy movie), and as a Jew in those times, Friedman is himself stuck in limbo between staunch racism and acceptance by the white community.James Cromwell plays Judge Foster, yet another man caught between the old world he has lived in his entire life and the fast-changing society and legal system that permits him to silence Marshall, while also forcing (somewhat) fair treatment of the accused Spell. Dan Stevens (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST) is Loren Willis, the disgusted and disgusting prosecutor. This character is so cartoonish that the only thing missing is a neon necklace that flashes \\\"racist\\\" as he speaks. Sophia Bush has a brief, yet important scene and Sterling K Brown (as Mr. Spell) has the film's most heart-breaking moment as he sits on the stand and explains why he lied.Director Reginald Hudlin seems like an odd choice for the project. He has been working mostly in TV since back-to-back-to-back bombs BOOMERANG (Eddie Murphy), THE LADIES MAN (Tim Meadow) and SERVING SARA (Matthew Perry). Mr. Hudlin has experienced more success as a Producer, having been Oscar nominated for DJANGO UNCHAINED. Here he works with the father and son screenwriters Jacob Koskoff and Michael Koskoff. The elder Michael is a well respected criminal attorney and legal historian, and certainly understands the expectations that come with offering a public look at a near- mythical figure \\u0085 especially one as revered as Thurgood Marshall.This isn't so much a movie about the icon as it is about a young man on the path to greatness and importance (he served on the Supreme Court from 1967-1991). The soundtrack is filled with jazz which complements the light-hearted approach, and further distances from any semblance of \\\"heavy\\\" or \\\"historical\\\". Director Hudlin adds a contemporary touch by having Trayvon Martin's parents (Sybrina Fulton, Tracy Martin) appear in a scene near the end. On the downside, multiple upshot camera angles are designed to make his lead character look larger than life. The truth is, Thurgood Marshall required no help in looming large. Hopefully this mainstream approach pays off and many are introduced to the legacy of a man who is more than worthy of this movie \\u0085 and another.\\n\\t3. I got to attend an early screening of Marshall tonight. I'm interested to see how critics react. I have a feeling many of them will object to the \\\"paint-by-numbers\\\" approach to the film. While we have not seen Thurgood Marshall represented much in film, it does feel like we've seen this movie more than once before. But that isn't really the point. I've eaten spaghetti and meatballs hundreds of times before. I still enjoy it each time, the same dish, so long as it is made well. And Marshall, while not reinventing any wheels, is made well. Chadwick Boseman leads a terrific cast that includes Josh Gad, Dan Stevens, James Cromwell, Kate Hudson and Sterling K. Brown. Everyone is there to give this very important true story some depth and weight. At the same time, the screenplay never gets too caught up in its own self-importance. While some very dark themes and tragic events are present, there is a sense of humor pervading much of the film. This makes the people and events portrayed in Marshall relatable, instead of feeling like we're watching a group of untouchable, stoic historical figures. Marshall isn't designed to inspire anger or guilt, instead it encourages us to examine examples of unity that have been used to overcome struggle. It has more in common with films like The Help or Hidden Figures, than more aggressive films like Detroit (though that film is very intense and impressive). I would say Marshall will play out just as well at home as it does in a theater, but there is something about seeing it with a crowd that in this case adds to the experience. The gasps of the audience when an atrocity is displayed, the clapping when a bigot loses his/her battle-it is a good film to enjoy with an audience. From a technical standpoint, the film does not go out of its way to impress. The cinematography, costume and production design, music, editing-all seems serviceable if not particularly memorable. In this case its the story and the figures it portrays that you'll remember. 7/10.\\n\\t4. Growing up one of the first influential black figures I learned about was Supreme Court Judge Thurgood Marshall. While my life didn't veer in the path he took, it was a chance for me as a young black male to see the dedication and time he took to his craft and where it could take you. Almost 2 decades have passed since then, and found myself surprised to see a film finally based on him and his capabilities. While the younger me was excited, I found myself wondering how this film would hold up side by side with other black period films like itself in recent history.Thurgood (Chadwick Boseman) is working in the NAACP when he is tapped for a court case of the accusation of a black male rumored to have raped a woman and thrown her off into the river and left for dead. While he travels to Connecticut for the trial, he finds himself hard pressed given he is a out of town lawyer unfamiliar to the client, and is left to have a inexperienced attorney (Josh Gad) to speak on his behalf in court. While Thurgood knows most of the material and how to move in court, he has to show Josh's character the way to observe things his way.The performances are all relatively solid by no surprise given the cast. Josh Gad is able to sell the inexperienced character almost having to be hand held through every decision made in the courtroom. Also the development of him progressively becoming more confident as time goes forward. The writing in the courtroom is interesting enough to keep you invested in knowing what's the truth and the holes in one plaintiff and defendants stories.Alas, my biggest issue with the film is really the lasting impact. While it is perfectly watchable in the moment, I felt as if a story like this should have had more lasting impact than what I saw given it's a film in a movie theater. It's not as riddled with clich\\u00e9s like preceding films I've seen in the past, but misses a strong distinctive voice. For some the issues I had with Hidden Figures, I at least know who the target audience was for the film and what they wanted to take from the movie. Marshall doesn't really have that same feeling. The writing is never bad, but never as sharp as it feels like it should be until the second half when more gets revealed.Marshall in a nutshell I would say is \\\"almost there\\\" as a movie. Fine within the moment but leaves a bit desired when the credits rolled. I wouldn't turn anyone away from seeing this, but may be best suited seen at home.\\n\\t5. This enjoyable and inspiring movie is a worthy contribution to the courtroom movie genre. It memorializes the great Thurgood Marshall (who later won Brown v. Bd. of Education and sat on the Supreme Court). The film brings to life a forgotten rape case in Connecticut that Marshall tried early in his career when he was the solo staff lawyer at the NAACP. The story focuses on the plight of a black man accused of raping a white woman and it highlights issues of racism in the courtroom and on the streets. The movie recalls the classic fllms \\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\\" (which also involved a black on white rape case) and \\\"Anatomy of a Murder\\\" (which also involved sexual issues and in which--like many real trials--we're never sure just what actually happened and who is telling the truth). The writing is sharp and witty and the acting and direction are great. Particularly strong is the emerging partnership and friendship of Marshall and the local lawyer, Sam Friedman, who had never tried a criminal case and thought he would just sit next to Marshall during the trial and and do nothing. But the judge forces Friedman to conduct the trial with Marshall serving as his adviser--and he rises to the occasion.\\n\\t6. Whether it's the Godfather of Soul, the first black baseball player, or the first black superhero, it's fair to say Chadwick Boseman is becoming one of the best actors of his generation.So there was high hopes for this bio-pic about NAACP Civil Rights lawyer and first black supreme court justice Thurgood Marshall.The film looks at one of the first cases of his career; a black chauffeur accused of rape by his white employer in Connecticut. Josh Gad is also in the film as a Jewish lawyer roped into being lead on the case when a judge decrees Marshall can only assist. This is important as the Gadd character has never tried a criminal case before.You keep expecting Boseman to get that nomination sooner or later, \\\"Get on Up\\\" should have been his ticket, but \\\"Marshall\\\" while pretty good in most areas, just doesn't feel like it has enough weight to it.I wish they did go with a bigger case of his, or just go all out and go with the one he's known most for- Brown v. Board of Education.The movie becomes another case of a black man being railroaded by a biased and corrupt system built on fabrications. For some that may be enough to hold them; the court room scenes that take up most of the movie are often rousing if not predictable.This is all pretty easy-going though- by the second half it's pretty much a comedy the lengths most of the white people in this movie will go to to hide their prejudices.At times it almost feels like their trying to start a Thurgood Marshall movie Universe here- like this one may not be that good but we'll tease you with some of the better stuff to come if you want it.But even so, Boseman brings life to this character, whether it's Marshall's perceptiveness or his gift of gab, he's cool because he knows he's the smartest guy in the room at any given time.Josh Gad has his moments but he still can't seem to fully get out of the goofy sidekick role. We'll have to see how he does in \\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\\".Oddly enough this is a bio-pic that comes across more as a crowd-pleasing good time than something that's going to be remembered at the end of the year, which is fine.I laughed, I was invested in the court trial mostly, the performances, including from Sterling K. Brown as the chauffeur are very good. Yet you just feel like it should have done more.So the score is 7 out of 10.

First there was James Brown the Godfather of Soul, then it was Jackie Robinson the first black player in modern times in major league baseball. Now it is Thurgood Marshall, but Marshall in his early days as a lawyer for the National Association For The Advancement Of Colored People.Thurgood Marshall in his career litigated many major civil rights cases including the most famous of all Brown vs. Board Of Education in 1954 that integrated the school system nationwide. Later on his career was capped by becoming the first black justice on the Supreme Court.This story takes place in the late 30s by the music and the radio broadcasts with the news of the day. Thurgood Marshall has been sent to Connecticut to defend Sterling K. Brown a black chauffeur on a charge of raping his employer Kate Hudson.This may be the north, but the racial attitudes in Greenwich, Connecticut are only more subdued than they are in Alabama. Fairfield County in those days in the richer suburban towns are pretty bad. You remember from Auntie Mame the phrase, Aryan from Darien. They're not crazy about Jews either.Marshall being an outsider to the state has to be admitted to the Connecticut bar. Local attorney Sam Friedman played by Josh Gad is the lead counsel temporarily and the first motion is to get Marshall admitted. That is usually a pro forma thing, note how Matt Damon has to be admitted to the bar in Tennessee in The Rainmaker.Such courtesy is denied Marshall by Judge James Cromwell. But he's allowed to sit at the defense table and coach Friedman. Despite a few curves thrown at the defense Gad who only did civil cases before this for insurance companies proves to be a pretty good advocate.Boseman steps up to his role just as he did with Jackie Robinson and James Brown. He also has some wonderful domestic scenes with his wife Keesha Sharp and at a nightclub with Jussie Smollett and Chilli Thomas as Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. Good performances you think these are the real people.Thurgood Marshall was also portrayed on screen by Sidney Poitier in the film Separate But Equal dealing with the school integration cases right up to the Supreme Court. These two really ought to be seen back to back for a full assessment of Marshall's career.In his time when Lyndon Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court it wasn't just race that made Marshall's appointment unique. It was the whole level of experience in the kind of law he practiced for people like Sterling K. Brown. The goal is justice and the law has to work for all for justice to be realized.Marshall is a film not to be missed.\\n\\t8. Thurgood Marshall was a legendary lawyer who became the first black judge in the US Supreme Court.Their is a good film to be made about his life, this is not it.Marshall focuses in one attempted murder case that he was involved in back in 1941 when he was a lawyer for the NAACP.It really is a modern version of To Kill a Mockingbird. A black man Joseph Spell is accused of raping a respectable married white woman who employed him. Spell then threw her off a bridge and left her to die.Marshall comes to Connecticut and teams up with a reluctant Jewish insurance lawyer Sam Friedman because the judge would not allow Marshall to be lead counsel.It is an effective courtroom drama, especially as Friedman is an inexperienced criminal lawyer who slowly discovers that there is more to law than insurance litigation.Chadwick Boseman shines as Marshall but there is nothing groundbreaking here as Marshall leads Friedman into the nuances of criminal litigation.\\n\\t9. Marshall is a sleek legal drama with great performances from Chadwick Boseman as the title character and Josh Gad. Don't be fooled by the snazzy vintage costumes, the real heart of Marshall's success is its screenplay and the chemistry between its lead actors.This film follows pioneering Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in his earlier years as a lawyer for the NAACP. A white socialite in Greenwich, Connecticut, accuses a black man of rape and attempted murder. The NAACP believes the man, Joseph Spell, is innocent and sends Marshall to defend him. Marshall enlists local lawyer Sam Friedman (Josh Gad) whose previous track record involves tax or insurance cases. Friedman worries about his family's safety due to the unrest the controversial trial causes. Sam and Thurgood must work together to defend Spell\\u0085and each other.This film is very good and so is its screenplay. The touches of comedy bring a welcome balance to its serious topic and difficult history. There is an array of good lines for Boseman and Gad. Several other actors get a chance to shine as well. I appreciate that Marshall takes its subjects seriously, but doesn't take on a dreary tone doing it. The scenes in the courtroom are intense and keep you interested in the action. As the case develops, these scenes get more and more engaging.While Boseman is very good as Thurgood Marshall, his performance is disappointing considering how hyped his portrayal has been in the film's ad campaign. He gives Marshall a suave personality but the script limits his ability to show off his range and really take the character on a journey. On the other hand, Josh Gad is a standout as Sam Friedman. He plays to his comedic strengths as Marshall's sidekick while also giving a genuinely good dramatic performance as a central and evolved character. He is a nice foil to Boseman and their chemistry reminds me of a buddy cop comedy.The lesson I take from the film is that you have to follow your moral compass even when it's hard. Sam's unwillingness to join the case makes sense. He is just starting out and worried that it could ruin his reputation. The fact that he does it anyway is a testament to the person Friedman must have been in real life.I give Marshall an age rating of 14 to 18 because of some racial and offensive language and suggestive and violent content, including depictions of the alleged assault. And my verdict on Marshall? 4 out of 5 stars. Marshall opens in theaters on October 13, 2017 so go check it out.Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.\\n\\t10. An exceptional story with great achievements and with great potential that delivers short in the movie, it could be a heartbreaking drama it could be an outstanding acting film but the played it safe, the cast, the screenplay, the pace, the script was just enough to make it work, yes the film is enjoyable, but without risks, just a great story captured in a regular but enjoyable movie.\\n\\t11. A powerful, engaging, sleek legal drama based on the facts .. a true story.. About one of the pioneer NAACP lawyer and his role during racial tensions .. how Thurgood Marshall was there \\\"not to extinguish fire but to be one\\\" in his words.. commendable performances by the protagonists Chadwick Boseman and Josh Gad.. a must see\\n\\t12. You would think it would be straight forward to come up with a provocative movie set in the US when segregation was in vogue. Not so! Roger Friedman is a decendant of Sam Friedman and a film critic who wrote an interesting article criticising the many inaccuracies in this film.So, the director and writers have an easy topic to critique history. They had a great man like Thurgood Marshall and some backward social attitudes that are as backward as our attitudes toward domestic violence today. Instead, the authors fill the movie with false facts and make Marshall look like an arrogant, unrefined twit (which he was neither). The directors and writers play the race card in all the wrong ways* and throw in a few sex jibes to top off a good dose of revisionism, undermining what could have been a great movie.As others have said, Josh Gad was the better principal actor in this movie. Sterling Brown as the accused was far more nuanced and capable than Chadwick Boseman as Marshall. Boseman is charming, but a totally wrong fit.I still give it a 6/10, which is very generous given the director and writers who totally failed to capture the essence of the story. The revisionist history and significant number of factual errors cast a large shadow over what could have been a great movie.Is the truth not interesting enough? The real Marshall is an amazing man - far better than Boseman's insulting copy.* Hollywood needs to curb its political correctness. I've banned my children from watching new movies until I screen them. That's how bad Hollywood has become. I know quite a few parents who feel the same way.\\n\\t13. I was hoping it would be a movie about the life of Thurgood Marshall. Instead it was focused on one case and didn't give much insight into Marshall at all. It was a decent movie, but with the life Marshall led, this can't have been even close to the most interesting story they could have told.\\n\\t14. It's 1941. Thurgood Marshall (Chadwick Boseman) travels the country as NAACP's only lawyer crusading for black defendants against the racist justice system. His next case is in Greenwich, Connecticut where rich housewife Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson) has accused her driver Joseph Spell (Sterling K. Brown) of raping her. Insurance lawyer Sam Friedman (Josh Gad) is recruited. He's reluctant and on top of that, Judge Foster (James Cromwell) refuses to accept Marshall into the local state bar. With Marshall silenced in court and with no criminal court experience, Friedman has to battle entitled prosecutor Loren Willis (Dan Stevens).This is a biodrama of one particular case with future Supreme Court judge Marshall. The story is compelling and the history is fascinating. The actors are all first rate. The actual court case does have some awkward turns. It's a thin line between blaming the victim and searching for the truth. It may help to definitively declare Spell as innocent from the start. This shouldn't be a courtroom mystery and should skew more towards underdog courtroom drama. If Marshall gets the truth from Spell at the beginning, he would come out looking even better. There are a lot of twisting that reminds me too much of a TV courtroom drama. I do love a lot of this movie but little things keep bugging me. For example, I love the kitchen knife joke but their kiss after temple strikes me as too much. I prefer a knowing touch and a sweet smile for her husband to drive home that scene much better. None of the little issues prevent me from really enjoying this well-acted compelling historical drama.\\n\\t15. I hate to say most, but there's a lot of biopics that are very formulaic in nature. And come to think of it, every genre deals with that issue. I can acknowledge that it's immensely hard to make a film that feels fresh and relevant at the same time. But I think the reason I tend to feel this way about biopics is because a lot of them seem to be directly aimed for the Oscar audience. And while that could be the case with Marshall, it's nothing less than a delightful film to watch.As with so many biopics, the main reason Marshall succeeds is Chadwick Boseman's unsurprisingly good turn as the famous lawyer, Thurgood Marshall. Whether or not Thurgood was this way in real life, I absolutely loved the sheer display of confidence in Boseman's portrayal. It was almost to the point of cockiness, without being arrogant. It's that balance that made me appreciate what this man brought to the table.Of course, there's also the dynamic of having a story that is still relevant to this day. Not only are people of color still discriminated, underestimated, and not believed in the court of law, but the idea of pitting race against race in the courtroom is something that is still unfortunately an issue today. So in a way, it was disheartening to watch the injustices happening throughout Marshall, as we know they are far from being over in the 1940's, but it's always nice to see something stick up for their people no matter what time period they are from.Boseman isn't the only one who gives a good performance as Josh Gad, Sterling K. Brown, Kate Hudson, James Cromwell, and a few others give valuable turns as their respected characters. I think my only issue with the film is that it ultimately felt very safe. I'm not one to know how these real life cases played out, but Marshall definitely feels like it took a guarded approach to the subject matter. Because of that, you can appeal to a mass audience, but I don't know that it was as detailed or thorough that it needed to be. Don't get me wrong, Marshall is a powerful film, but I think it could have taken an even further step forward into that realm.8.2/10\\n\\t16. Marshall\\nDirected by Reginald Hudlin. Written by Michael Koskoff and Jacob KoskoffI watch a variety of films. I like horror and thrillers but at the same time can enjoy a historical drama as well. This movie falls into that category. Marshall stars Chadwick Boseman(Black Panther) as Thurgood Marshall as he travels to Bridgeport, Connecticut to help a black man accused of raping a well to do woman. He is not allowed to participate in the court proceedings so his proxy is Josh Gad who is not a criminal defense attorney. This is all based on a true story. So it has that going for it.This is a perfect example of a fine movie. A fine movie is enjoyable. A fine movie has quality performances throughout. A fine movie tells a story that you can follow and you might even be invested in but a fine movie doesn't do more than that. This is an important story. It tells how Marshall has this last trial to get the NAACP going in respect to civil rights progress.It does all of this just fine. It just never engages more than that. It hits all the spots that it is supposed to hit when it comes to this kind of story. I hate trying to talk about movies like this. There is little to say because the movie tells it's courtroom drama adequately enough. It doesn't present with too much visual flair because the story is the most important aspect. I think it could have done with some melodramatics and some out there visual flair. It might have engaged with the pictures more than just the beat by beat it gives you.I realize that I've not said anything about Black Panther himself. He's alright. He doesn't look a thing like Thurgood Marshall but that's not a big thing in this case. Sometimes it can be off putting. Sometimes it can be at the expense of who the character is internally. This does that somewhat. The case is the focal point.I give this movie a C.\\n\\t17. A look at the career of Thurgood Marshall. Maybe more people will know who he is and what exactly he accomplished.Kudos entire cast was riveting!\\n\\t18. Packed house last night at the AMC Lincoln Center Theater for the NY Times Film Club premiere, a crowd of old white presumably liberal folk with a noticeably Jewish vibe. What you'd expect from the Times Film Club, I suppose, but the absence of black faces was very strange, and put the whole experience out of kilter for me. The film seems aimed at a much younger and blacker audience. When, at the beginning of the film, Boseman offhandedly ordered Gad to carry his bags, and Gad complied immediately, the lone outburst of \\\"Whoa!\\\" fell into almost total (shocked?) silence. That set the tone for me. Marshall is flat-out superhero here, the master bringing sidekick Friedman rapidly up to speed on the state of the Real World. That Waking Up Friedman subplot runs in and out of the main courtroom rape drama, where Sterling K Brown and Kate Hudson nearly steal the show with their far more realistic turns as Spell and Strubing, and James Cromwell and Dan Stevens are skin-crawlingly detestable as judge and prosecutor stooping ever lower to defend the racist ivory tower of Bridgeport CT. How this will do immediately at the box office depends on a lot of other factors, including the trailers. But my guess is that the inherent value of the story, which couldn't be more timely, will connect with audiences on a deep level, while the shenanigans on the surface keep them entertained, and the in the end they'll put it together in their own way. I expect this will be a keeper, something that will be on TV and video for a long, long time, and that \\\"Marshall\\\" will enter the rap lexicon on several levels very quickly.\\n\\t19. 'MARSHALL': Four Stars (Out of Five)A courtroom drama/biopic about the first African-American Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall, and one of his first big cases. The movie stars Chadwick Boseman as Marshall, and it was directed by Reginald Hudlin (some fun trivia, Hudlin wrote the Marvel comic book 'Black Panther', from 2005 to 2008, and Boseman is now playing the character in the Marvel Studios movies). The screenplay was written by Michael and Jacob Koskoff. Josh Gad, Kate Hudson, Sterling K. Brown, Dan Stevens and James Cromwell all costar in the legal drama. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I enjoyed it.The story takes place in 1940 Bridgeport Connecticut. It revolves around Thurgood Marshall (Boseman), an NAACP lawyer who was traveling around the country defending people wrongly accused of crimes due to their color. He's sent to Connecticut to defend a chauffer, named Joseph Spell (Brown), who was accused of raping his employer, a white woman named Eleanor Strubing (Hudson). An insurance lawyer, named Sam Friedman (Gad), attempts to get Marshall admitted to the local bar, but the judge (Cromwell) refuses to allow him tospeak during the trial. So Friedman is forced to become Spell's lead counsel, with Marshall assisting him through notes and whispers. \\n \\nThe movie is a pretty routine courtroom drama, but it's much more involving because of it's social commentary (on the racism of that time). It's got a great cast, especially Boseman in the lead, who makes a very powerful and charismatic leading man. The film is involving, and aptly directed, but it's also mostly predictable. It's still a lot of fun to watch though, and movies about racial injustice are always important.\\n\\t20. As always, when I watch a movie based on real events, I try to compare to what really happened and I usually end up not liking the movie that much because of this. With this one I think they did an excellent job with the case, being pretty faithful to what really happened, with some details changed, but most of it is pretty accurate. Chadwick Boseman turns up another excellent performance as the titular Thurgood Marshall. The production design is impeccable and the courtroom scenes very engaging. So everything seems fine with this movie, with one notable exception, Sam Friedman, here played by Josh Gad. Everything about him is wrong and a total disrespect for the man. This case was mostly won by him with very little help from Marshall, which begs the question, if you wanted to make a movie about Thurgood Marshall why choose a case in which he didn't have that big of an impact, and change everything to make it look like he did? Why not make a movie about his most famous cases? I really can't answer this questions and it casts a giant shadow over the movie.\\n\\t21. Marshall appeared to be written to the audience of people who probably did not know very much about the early NAACP, or Thurgood Marshall in general. The movie did not captivate his pinnacle case \\\"Brown vs Board of Education Topeka\\\" or his ascension to the Supreme Court. The movie did not highlight any of his 32 cases before the United States Supreme Court. This movie was an introductory that raises one's interest in the subject of this man, his contributions to civil rights, and obstacles that faced African Americans during this period of United States History.I would recommend this movie to people who are very knowledgeable of Justice Marshall, or perhaps not fully aware of the ramifications of his life's work. Perhaps millennial, like myself, who cannot fully appreciate the journey and progress of civil rights, were the target audience of this movie.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and think it is currently undervalued. The actor who played Justice Marshall was great, the actor who played Mr. Friedman was excellent as well. I would also like to give a shoutout to the way the movie portrayed the residing judge of this case, because he was a very significant character and his transitions in the movie truly gave the movie a climactic moment that really resonated with me. I would recommend Marshall to any of my friends and thought it was great.\\n\\t22. This film tells the story of a African American lawyer, who fights against social Injustice by helping people who are charged with crimes because of their skin color.\\\"Marshall\\\" tells a compelling story of the fight for the right and just. The story is gripping because it is not an easy fight. Indeed, the African American characters evoke much sympathy and really connects with the viewers. I enjoyed it a lot.\\n\\t23. It is set in Greenwich, Connecticut, in 1941 and is \\\"based on\\\" one of Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall's early civil rights cases when he was a practicing lawyer.Thurgood Marshall (Chadwick Boseman) is a young NAACP staff lawyer sent to Greenwich, Connecticut, to defend Joseph Spell (Sterling K. Brown) against the charge of raping and attempting to kill his white employer, Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson). He was said to have raped her, then bound her, and thrown her off a bridge. However, she managed to swim to shore and then reported the rape. Since Marshall came from out-of-state, he needed a local lawyer to be part of the case. Sam Friedman (Josh Gad) was a Jewish lawyer who only handled civil, not criminal, cases. He was initially reluctant to take the case. The movie depicts Judge Foster (James Cromwell) as biased and the prosecutor, Loris Willis) as an Ivy League snob. The Judge allows Marshall to sit the second chair but not to make arguments or question witnesses, so Marshall coaches Friedman throughout the trial.The movie then details the trial with flashbacks to illustrate Eleanor Strubing's story and later illustrates Joseph Spell's claim that the sex was consensual, that he had initially approached her for money, and that she had invited the sex. He said that Strubing only panicked after the fact and jumped off the bridge of her own volition. Friedman manages to raise doubt based on gaps and contradictions in Strubing's story, and the jury ultimately finds Spell not guilty.This was quite a famous trial when it took place in early 1941. It was a front-page story in the New York Times when the incident happened (the story is in the December 12, 1940 issue of the Times.). Contrary to the film, Sam Friedman and Thurgood Marshall were much more equal than portrayed in the film. Friedman was a bit older and already had a reputation for theatrical performance in courts. He had been hired by the NAACP before Marshall got to town. Indeed, Friedman did act as the lead defense lawyer in the trial. Again contrary to the film, Joseph Spell had admitted from the beginning that he had sex with Eleanor Strubing but always insisted it was consensual. Strubing's contradictory story included a ransom note that was never found and a rope said to have bound her hands that were never found. There were actual doubts about her story from the beginning. Nonetheless, it was a remarkable success story for the NAACP.This is an interesting film. The relationship between Marshall and Friedman includes humor and Friedman's sensibilities arising from his own Jewish background. Chadwick Boseman is excellent as a self-confident black lawyer. Josh Gad is a good complement to the Marshall character.\\n\\t24. Leaving aside the civil justice warrior biography template that's slightly overdone in Hollywood - this film works on every other front. The acting is exceptional, the script and storylines well selected.For a biography, enough shades of grey though there could have been more, the story is an important one. The direction and editing also deserves a mention. The character of Sam is very well created/portrayed and despite the high brow thrill of courtroom drama, it brings home truths and lies close to reality.If not for anything, it is a story of America, its history and its values told from the perspective of one phenomenal man's fight along the way. Watch it for the story if not anything else!\\n\\t25. Before he played the lead in Marvel Studios' superhero sage \\\"Black Panther,\\\" actor Chadwick Boseman played a genuine African-American hero in \\\"Boomerang\\\" director Reginald Hudlin's \\\"Marshall,\\\" a sterling biographical courtroom yarn about civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall. As it turns out, this is the same individual who argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court and then later donned the robes as the first African-American to sit on the highest federal court of the United States. It doesn't hurt matters that seasoned civil rights advocate Michael Koskoff and his son Jacob penned the screenplay. Interestingly, the elder Koskoff still serves as an attorney in Connecticut, where the trial took place in 1941, so he would know something about the hurdles that Marshall had to negotiate. At this point in his life, Marshall worked as the sole legal counsel for the NAACP, and his NAACP superior Walter White (Roger Guenveur Smith of \\\"Eve's Bayou\\\") dispatches him to all parts of the country to defend poor African-Americans who cannot afford an attorney.\\\"Marshall\\\" depicts the title character as a sharp, savvy, sartorially elegant attorney who refused to be intimidated by anybody. Boseman has a field day incarnating this historical personage. Neither Hudlin nor the Koskoffs reveal a great deal about Thurgood Marshall beyond his dedication to the rights of African-Americans in a legal system skewered against them. Indeed, we do learn about the problems that Marshall and his wife Vivien \\\"Buster\\\" Burey (Keesha Sharp of \\\"Malibu's Most Wanted\\\") encountered in their repeated but futile efforts to get pregnant. Eventually, she does have a baby. Nevertheless, Hudlin and the Koskoffs don't let Marshall's own life history interfere with the trial at hand. Mind you, \\\"Marshall\\\" clocks in two minutes short of two hours, but Hudlin doesn't malinger. The trial in question takes place in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The authorities have arrested a middle-aged, African-American chauffeur, Joseph Spell (Sterling K. Brown of \\\"Brown Sugar\\\"), for allegedly raping a Greenwich socialite, Mrs. Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson of \\\"Deepwater Horizon\\\"), and then throwing her into a reservoir late one evening. According to Koskoff, when the press broke the story, one newspaper touted it as \\\"the sex trial of the century.\\\" When Marshall visits Spell in his jail cell, the attorney explains that the NAACP represents only innocent blacks. Spell assures Marshall that he did not rape Strubing. Furthermore, he has an alibi for his whereabouts when the crime occurred, and the witness in question turns out to be a white policeman who is prepared to testify.As the case unfolds, Marshall realizes that he lacks the appropriate credentials to practice law in Connecticut, so he finds a gullible but willing Jewish insurance attorney, Sam Friedman (Josh Gad of \\\"Pixels\\\"), to help him represent Spell. Friedman constantly has second thoughts about the trial and the dire publicity that may irreparably damage his budding civil practice. Nevertheless, he agrees to serve as Spell's mouthpiece. Meantime, the abrasive Judge Foster (James Cromwell of \\\"L.A. Confidential\\\") refuses to let Marshall utter a syllable during the trial and threatens to hold him in contempt if he does. Throughout the trial, Marshall must coach Friedman because the latter hasn't argued a criminal case. If these two strikes against our sympathetic, but snappy hero aren't enough, Marshall discovers about half-way through the case that Spell has been lying to them. Indeed, Spell didn't rape Strubing! Instead, he had intimate consensual relations with her, because her abusive, bad-tempered husband, John Strubing (Jeremy Bobb of \\\"Boy Wonder\\\"), often left her alone at night. Naturally, Friedman struggles to improvise, but he falls into too many traps laid by prosecuting attorney Loren Willis (Dan Stevens of \\\"The Guest\\\"), who is supremely confident that he will win a conviction. Of course, the good citizens of Bridgeport aren't happy with both Marshall and Friedman, and they go after them with fists. Friedman suffers the worst, getting beaten to his knees, and walking away with minor scars on his face. Marshall grins at him and points out that the local press lumped him with Marshall as a crusading NAACP lawyer.\\\"Marshall\\\" qualifies as a well-made but routine courtroom drama bolstered by terrific performances and historical accuracy.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Instructions:\\n  1.

Don't expect Marvel, and don't expect Breaking Bad, but do expect a few interesting moments.

A thing some have been talking about was that it doesn't add anything new and while it is true, I also don't think it needs to. The movie is enjoyable to watch and it definitely had potential. My complaint with this movie is with the characters. The characters have little to no development or depth. Again I want to restate that it's not a bad movie, at points, you can feel as if the characters could be real people and connect with them. However these moments are cliche and very few. At it's worst, the movie will throw ideas in the air and never come back to them. Special effects are very well done and don't let down. The plot was generic but still enjoyable. Overall, this movie is good for casual audiences and people that just wanna sit down and turn off their brain for an hour after a long day. If you want something with a lot more to offer than this then I wouldn't recommend watching this movie.\\\", 'It is a passable movie with good looking, made for TV, leads and reasonable effects.

Watchable once and maybe again a year or two from now. A definite go.\\\", '\\\"Code 8\\\" is quite the indie success, it was heavily crowd-funded (2.1 million in kickstarter) and it seems to me no backer was let down. While presenting a story consisting of rather familiar arcs and themes, it\\\\'s still packed tightly and driven forward by decent characters, good acting & well done special FX. It reminded me of the very recent indie feature \\\"Freaks\\\" - both of these movies deal with the x-men-esque story about humans with abilities & their trials and tribulations in the common world. Both movies are solid.\\\"Code 8\\\" is a tale about Connor Reed (Robbie Amell), a man with certain abilities, living in a world where people like him are being suppressed. The desperation created by the circumstances around him drive him to risk his life and safety to make money, and so the many endeavours ensue. As I previously mentioned, the story is built of arcs and themes which are routine enough, but \\\"Code 8\\\" has a lot to compensate with. For starters, the (also familiar) characters are delivered by a cast of great actors, including the Amell cousins, Greg Byrk as the villain, Sunk Kang - whom I hadn\\\\'t seen for a long time, and a likely overlooked performance by Kyla Kane. The most valued possession of \\\"Code 8\\\" is probably the special FX, cinematography and production design. For a movie of this budget it looks admirably awesome, the style is on-point and contained, no overkills, no on-the-noise cheap frames or visual solutions, might as well be a big-screen flick. Sound design\\\\'s up there as well.\\\"Code 8\\\" is like a humbler, more focused indie \\\"X-men\\\", a solid directional effort in the sci-fi genre that\\\\'s not by any means flawless, but delivers most of what it promises. Personally, the one thing I disliked the most was the too conventional type of ending, a more extra ordinary last note would\\\\'ve been nice. I recommend \\\"Code 8\\\" to all the sci-fi lovers out there. My rating: 7/10.', 'In a near future, the construction worker Conner Reed (Robbie Amell) has abilities that are forbidden by the government.

The Amell cousins have been wanting to do this movie for years, and even debuted the short film during the H&V Chicago Comic Con I attended back in 2016, and you can clearly see the passion, blood, sweat and tears behind the production. It's not overly original nor is it really trying to be.

This hyped me up even more. Everything was great (besides some acting and pacing issues) up until the ending.I try to not get disappointed by films but this film actually hyped me up because I love independent and interesting sci-fi.And then the ending hit me like a freight train. It's so unimaginative, so boring, so cliche. They never took any risks, they never tried to surprise, to play off the characters they've had.While watching this I got that Upgrade (2018) vibe. I really thought that they will do something insanely cool with their ending (like Upgrade did). And this one was the most boring and off-putting thing ever imagined.Sorry, guys, but as much as I wanted to give this film 8/10 just to promote independent sci-fi, this film just struck me right through the heart.

Acting is not bad, special effects are really good though.\\\", \\\"For a low budget si-fi movie, it is not bad at all. Code 8 takes place in the future, where people with certain levels of powers are being casted out to make everyone equal. Forcing them to register, and hide their powers from other so they can work. Failing to do so has it's consequences, which forces some turn to a life of crime.The special effects in this movie are better than some of the higher budget movies, and the story line isn't bad. Stephen, Robbie, and Sung Kang did a great job acting, and made me want to see more. It does get a little bit Hollywood with the raising money for treatment, but it does have some original ideas which made me enjoy this film. Some of the powers displayed in this movie will make you do a double take, which is why I like the originality of most of it.I would give it a 7 out of 10 stars for some of the original ideas, but unfortunately it does fall into the same pattern as the Hollywood cliche.\\\"]\",\n          \"[\\\"I'm someone who wants to fix everything and this was kinda wake up call for me. Just watched when I needed something like this.\\\", \\\"I'm a sucker for time travel movies and trying to fix what went wrong. Add a romance to that and I'm often a bigger sucker.This movie is okay. It's sweet and silly and sometimes a bit ludicrous, but above-average fun.I think that the biggest surprise and the movie's saving grace is Skyler Gisondo as Evan. I've never seen him before, but his work here is remarkable. He takes what could have been a thankless, ridiculous second banana role and arguably makes the whole film so much more than it would be without him.If you watch this movie just to see what Skyler does with his part, and think about - and this is apropos for a time travel movie - the acting choices he could have made, or what another lesser actor might have done with the role, you won't be sorry.\\\", 'Stillman (Asa Butterfield) is a physics genius who\\\\'s girlfriend Debbie (Sophie Turner) breaks up with him and she says that it\\\\'s because she is unhappy. So he creates a time machine to go back and change all the times that he made her unhappy, with the help of his friend Evan (Skyler Gisondo).What I loved about this movie was that it doesn\\\\'t take itself to seriously and there were some genuine laugh-out-loud and enjoyable moments. The acting was top notch from all three main characters. The chemistry between the struggling couple is electric and very relatable and the banter and bond between the two friends is very amusing.But that said the writer and director (Andrew Bowler) did a brilliant job of understanding the possible consequences of changing the past and creating a \\\"perfect\\\" life. His message is that if we don\\\\'t make mistakes and struggle in life then we don\\\\'t learn or grow. We would be stuck in time, never moving forward which is expressed in a romantic \\\"boy meets girl\\\" rather than dramatic \\\"save the universe\\\" way, which I thought was a breath of fresh air.This movie visualises a situation I for one have thought about, where often someone is the Yin to our Yang and opposites attract at first but over time one of you realises that you\\\\'re growing a part. When you look back on the relationship after it has ended, your life seems to be over and it\\\\'s easy to wish you could have a do-over. But that isn\\\\'t how life works, we\\\\'re meant to hurt, struggle, make mistakes and most of all learn from them. All so that when someone does come along who seems perfect for us we don\\\\'t make the same mistakes we did in the past.', 'Stillman is distraught after his girlfriend Debbie decides to break up with him. A genius physics student, he perfects a time travel device. He introduces it to his best friend Evan and tells of his plan to travel back to what he has identified as the biggest problem spots in the two years he was with Debbie and fix the issues. He and Evan go back and inhabit their own bodies during these points in time as Stillman makes multiple attempts to change events for the better.Time Freak does at least explore modern relationships provocatively and honestly. Its ultimate message about how there\\\\'s no \\\"quick fix\\\" for a failing relationship.Things get more substantial during the second half where Andrew Bowler expands out beyond making merely a romantic comedy and features some more imaginative scenes .The latter sections abandon the romantic aspect and have an interesting plot about how Asa Butterfield has edited the timelime to remove all conflict, meaning that Sophie Turner feels bored and aimless with her domesticated life. The final scenes of the film are ones where the romantic element eventually clicks into place quite nicely.', \\\"Put this on not expecting a lot but also because I enjoy time travel movies.\\\\nI am sure there will be people who didn't like it ot will spell out all the problems with the time travel theories. But if you just sit back and watch this movie and dont take it too seriously it is pretty good. Enjoyed Sansa Stark as well.Over-all 6.4\\\", 'In the bonus track of the DVD of \\\"Time Freak,\\\" writer-director Andrew Bowler described how his film was an expanded version of a short film of the same title that was nominated for an Academy Award. The DVD even includes the earlier film in its entirety. It turns out that the original, brief film was more interesting and engaging than the longer version, validating the time-honored adage in writing that \\\"less is more.\\\"The conceit of the film is a \\\"what if?\\\" question related to the possibility of going back in time to change the past. In the bonus track of the DVD, Bowler observed that he wanted to explore the consequences of a single, crucial moment in a human life that, if changed, would alter the course of a relationship of a young couple.Unfortunately, the film was a misfire because the protagonist named Stillman uses his time machine to change literally hundreds of moments in his relationship with Debbie. The character does not want to change one thing; rather, he his goal is to change EVERY thing, so as to avoid arguments with his girlfriend, avoid her rejecting him, and live a perfect life with no dissonance. Of course, this idea is so absurd (\\\"cosmically\\\" absurd, as Stillman comes to realize) that even Debbie cannot stand it when she finally learns that she has been victimized by a time machine.In the extras segment of the DVD, Bowler stated that his goal was to create primarily a romantic comedy. The lead actress playing Debbie claimed that she was laughing out loud while reading the script. But the final product was not funny, and the romantic elements were disappointing because of the absence of chemistry in the principal relationship. Stillman was a physics nerd desiring an ordered and disciplined life. Debbie was a free spirit, a singer without predetermined life goals. It is difficult to imagine a more mismatched pair than Stillman and Debbie. Indeed, the underdeveloped relationship of Stillman\\\\'s sidekick Evan and his relationship with \\\"Blue Ribbons\\\" was far more intriguing.The film was well-photographed with interesting locations in Atlanta. It was also interesting watch British actors successful realize American dialect in their speech. But \\\"Time Freak\\\" failed as a dynamic romantic comedy. The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche wrote of the concept of eternal recurrence, wherein our actions are destined to repeat themselves throughout time with no recourse to recovering and altering past. That is the ultimate lesson of Stillman and his misguided time machine.', \\\"Some scenes were expected but I still enjoyed the movie. Sophie's American accent is also getting better. I enjoyed listening to her pronunciations. Lol. Asa has always been a good actor and Skyler's humor added a spice in the movie.\\\", \\\"Terrible movie. Asa Butterfield as genius? Maybe. And he does a decent job acting the part. As a leading 'boy' in a relationship with Sophie Turner? She tries her best, but many moments were so awkward between the two of them, they were downright cringe-worthy. Zero chemistry and boy....does it show. Not sure what the producers were thinking putting these two together in a supposed romance.That aside, Skyler Gisondo steals the show and does a fine job trying to save this mess but being the Asa/Sophie relationship is the plot of the entire movie, you can feel confident steering clear of this disaster and saving the hour and a half of your life.\\\", \\\"The main reason to watch this movie are the actors, they are cute kids in what amounts to a rom-com but with a semi-serious message at the end. Curiously the two leads are both British but their American accents are so good you'd never know if you didn't know.They are in college in Denver and boy meets girl, they get along, but after some time the girl says it won't work. The boy, a Physics prodigy of sorts, decides it is his fault, so he invents a way to travel back and forth in time, figuring he can go back and correct the problems and keep the girl.It is an entertaining movie for the most part, although it gets a bit muddled in the second half. Then too much back-N-forth time travel starts to have undesired effects. Ultimately the message they deliver is not to mess with life too much, work with what you have.I watched it on Amazon streaming movies.\\\", \\\"This is a fun lighthearted movie that reminds me of Being Erica or TNG episode called Tapestry - where you can go back in time and change past mistakes to produce an ideal outcome. As you can guess, the lesson learned is that manipulating the past does not lead to the perfect outcome. Good idea although nothing new.What I like about the movie? Skyler Gisondo as the friend Evan IS the heart and humor of the movie. I would watch it again just for his comedic performance that kept me in stitches. I looked forward to each and every scene he was in and he did not disappoint.What could have been better? I didn't feel the chemistry between the two main leads. I believe that part of the problem lies with how Stillman was written and partially the casting choice.While Sophie Turner was okay as Debbie, I feel that Zooey Deschanel would have been a better choice. If I closed my eyes and just listened to the voices, it almost sounded like that's what Sophie was going for.Asa Butterfield as Stillman came off as a bit conceited and whiny. It was hard to feel sympathy for him at any point. The scriptwriter could've made him more likeable and a different casting choice would've helped also. Maybe someone like Adrian Grenier in She Drives Me Crazy (1999)? Someone that you feel sorry for would've helped.If the script was tweaked a little and different people cast in the leading roles, this would've easily been an 8. They didn't do anything wrong and there were genuinely funny moments, but it lacked that certain spark that could've really made it great.\\\", \\\"Yes, it is a time travel movie. But it's terrible. As far as the acting is concerned, Asa butterfied does a good job on his character. Though I didn't expect such a poor performance from Sophie Turner. Poor casting. The cast looks too young for the part they play. Overall the movie seems like it was shot by a group of college kids from their college dorm.\\\", \\\"A boy-genius meets the love of his life.\\\\nA few months later they have split up - cue the time machine to get her back.At first glance I knew I had definitely been here before - but I was wrong.On the surface you can enjoy this as a very simple, quaint romance with the odd joke thrown in.The sci-fi element of this is kept on the down low.\\\\nThere are no annoying sequences about paradoxes, dichotomies or accidentally shagging your own parents here.\\\\nThis is all about the relationships of the three main characters and the choices we make in life.Straight away the leads do not look like they are an actual couple and I assumed their chemistry would be garbage.This, however, is one of the strengths of the film and what sets it apart.This will really resonate with anyone who (like me) has gone out with someone who is clearly hotter and more vivacious than themselves.\\\\nThere was something painfully familiar seeing the lead character snowballing trivial disagreements in to major issues due to a lack-of-confidence, fear and jealousy.\\\\nThen of course the harder he tries to fix things the more damage he causes.The characters are great in this; they are so believable they almost feel like people from my actual past.\\\\nThe story is simple but non-judgmental - I found myself rooting for all parties involved all the time.Despite having some depth this remains a nice light watch, there is no nudity, violence, political agendas, and it won't stretch your brains or emotions too far either.An excellent watch!\\\", \\\"I am over 40. This seems like it was made for the teen/20's market. I enjoyed it. I enjoy all things time travel. I thought they did a good job using it to tell the story. The movie had a good life lesson in the end and it was a sweet story really. The actor who played the best friend was very good. He rounded out the main three of them and added humor and the more practical side of things. I did not expect to like it as much as I did. Enjoyable 90 minutes.\\\", 'Skyler Gisondo, best aspect of this film, really saves it from being fairly irritating, adding a much needed comedy angle (as the rest is just some guy being terrible at relationships with well anyone it seems, and just doing it over and over and over again, until he gets the response he wants, which sounds cute, but really is a tiny bit psychotic).\\\\nMaybe im being too cynical, I did watch it to the end...so i guess not that bad right? :)', \\\"I wasn't sure about this film but as soon as I watched it I found it very helpful in terms of reminding me it's okay to be imperfect as a human and we don't need to be in control of every single situation. as we improve, learn and grow we have to have our own flaws and it's a okay to make mistakes! not very scientific but brilliant and a awakening\\\", 'Well, this is not a great film, with a complex plot, however, that does not prevent the film from having its value, a message, that although it is not very original, it is always good to remember ...\\\\nA light entertainment, but when it ends it leaves something that many films reported as deeper do not leave: They leave a reflection.', 'This modern-tech take on the \\\"Groundhog day\\\" with a touch of \\\"Back to the Future\\\" starts interesting. It has some good or at least interesting jokes. Like, our main character has a time machine that he controls with a phone. And it often malfunctions, showing the silly \\\"busy\\\" signs (whatever happened to the good-old sand-watch?), or simply flashing silly or showing that some feature \\\"is offline\\\".Also, the idea that he tries to fix things he did wrong in the past with his girlfriend, presumably making him dump him, but it doesn\\\\'t help, she still dumps him, is interesting.But, by the time they ditch that idea, as he does manage to \\\"evade the dumping\\\", things take a turn for the worse. The fun and funny start taking a back seat, but other stuff wasn\\\\'t that good to begin with - and it, too, gets worse.By the end, we have a silly and misguided feminist rant about \\\"you can\\\\'t control me\\\" and a bunch of other stuff not making much sense.

There is writer/director who can not write even semi decent story, can not direct, and he got some, let say it not nice, but I'm really not in mood to be nice - B grade actors, what means actually good actors + money to film unoriginal idea, absolutely nonsense and full with overdone, too long scenes (like that 'car chase' at the end) plot, extremely poor storytelling.Casting: Asa Butterfield is good actor, but he just looks like having 16 years.

And after all it\\\\'s not boring if you are in the mood to watch a light movie.', \\\"The main idea behind the story was good and interesting. Though, the movie started a bit odd, as they just threw the time machine at us without having explained some things first. I also liked the way they presented the love story. However, the lead actor Asa looked like a kid and I couldn't really commit to his romance with the girl as the ultimate love story. The plot got messed up towards the end, with no meaning and not plot. So, 4 out of 10.\\\", 'Reading the concept I was struck by two things. First the philisophical and moral implications of what our antagonist does and secondly just how incredibly creepy the whole thing is.Quickly the movie further descends into creepiness but it really does make you think.What I liked about Time Freak is that it doesn\\\\'t gloss over how questionable the whole thing is, it embraces it and the last third of the movie heavily puts a spotlight on it.It tells the story of a young man who builds a time machine after his girlfriend leaves him to go back and fix things. You see what I mean about morals vs creepiness?Starring Sophie \\\"Sansa\\\" Turner it plays out like a generic Hollywood romantic comedy but with this twist. By the end it\\\\'s fairly hard hitting, thought provoking and certainly got my heart aflutter (But if anyone asks I will so totally deny it)The awfully titled Time Freak is funny, heartfelt and is one of those film concepts I\\\\'ll be thinking about for a longtime to come.Despite the questionable ethics it\\\\'s a really fun little movie.The Good:Sophie TurnerVery original conceptWell woven little taleThe Bad:The concept is creepier the more you think about itThings I Learnt From This Movie:Sophie Turner cannot singDonkey punch has been demoted to donkey slapJason Hervey has been reborn as Skyler Gisondo', 'This was a fun and cute movie. Although the ending didnt make much sense to me. The moral of the story is, that screw ups and mistakes are part of life and relationships. But some people are just not meant to be together because they are too different like Debbie and Stillman. So why do they still end up together in the end. The whole time- machine destruction was kind of pointless. It was a much stronger ending if they just let eachother go and accepted the fact that they were not meant to be together. And that the whole experience was a lesson to Stillman. So yeah fun movie but a weak ending.', 'Time Freak is a new romantic Sci-Fi film directed and written by Andrew Bowler, the director of The Descent of Walter McFea.The film is about the brilliant teenager Stillman (Asa Butterfield). Everything in his life seems perfect to go, until the day he is dumped by his girlfriend Debby (Sophie Turner). Stillman thinks up and finds a time machine to go back in time with his friend Evan (Skyler Gisondo) to discover why Debbie dumped him. In this way he tries to adjust everything to ensure that he stays in a romantic relationship with Debbie.Andrew Bowler based this new film on his short film of the same name in 2011. This film tells more of a time travel story on a younger level. Young viewers can have more fun with this film and the film is also written in a simple way without the way of time travel being explained to the public in a difficult way.For older viewers the film may seem a bit too simple and due to the lack of details and explanation about how certain things are possible or happen in the film, it may also seem unclear. The characters in the film also try to solve more problems with time travel, which children or teenagers experience earlier in their lives. Older viewers can keep up with classic time travel films such as Back to the Future.The effects in the film also look a bit simple and meant for a younger audience. The film attributes that the time machine has to imagine, are somewhat cheap. That is why the big machine is soon replaced by a smartphone app that makes time travel possible.The entire cast also consists of a young cast. Asa Butterfield and Sophie Turner are doing well in this film, but have done better work in better films in their acting career. Skyler Gisondo knows how to create entertaining scenes with the comic commentary of his character on the actions of the main character.', \\\"Oddly entertaining enough to justify a watch but don't expect to much.\\\"]\",\n          \"[\\\"As an ex PPO (Trained, still licensed, but not active) I have to remark that one of the many positives from this movie was it wasn't all 'glossy'. The BG wasn't portrayed as a superwoman who had amazing insights and powers. It came across as she was slightly OCD about surveillance and escape routes (ain't we all?) and a little neurotic and distrustful (again, not a bad thing). The fight scenes were realistic insomuch she took a kicking as she was physically smaller, but possessed the will to drive on and fight out.All in all, it may not be an Oscar winner as it lacked entertainment value, but being a PPO isn't about providing entertainment. Personally, I think this is up there with 13 hrs in its portrayal of what the Private Security industry is about - poles apart, but professional\\\", 'I like Noomi Rapace and have seen and enjoyed most of her movies, at least the ones after the \\\"Girl With...\\\" series. I find her compelling. Although not traditionally beautiful, she has presence with a kind of rough grace that presents as extremely attractive and she is also one of the few women who can pull off high-action movies. If I see she is in something, I watch it, and have yet to be disappointed. Without her in the lead, I probably wouldn\\\\'t have watched this,When I saw Sophie N\\u00e9lisse I couldn\\\\'t figure out where I had seen her before until I realized she was Liesal and Gilly Hopkins.The acting was okay; Nelisse an Rapace were effective in their roles. The setting and scenery were fine. The action was well done with only a few weapon mistakes. Overall, I enjoyed the film - it won\\\\'t win awards but it\\\\'s better than most action/buddy movies.Very watchable, if only for Noomi, who is always good.', \\\"Good for a casual watch. Suspicious that each ok review has a corresponding poor one. As if someone is trying to talk the movie down (or up). It's certainly not as bad as the 1/10 and 2/10 scores suggest.\\\", 'Good acting by Noomi and Sophie, doing their best with a script that could have been a lot better. Movie overall had a strong start that faded to a weak finish. On balance, worth seeing because of the two leads.', \\\"In fact this movie is enjoyable with suspense, action and kick-ass Noomi Rapace to round it all off. The story starts off well but weakens at the end. Nevertheless it provides a well earned hour and a half of pleasant entertainment.It deserves a rating of 7, more then the average rating of most respondents to date. Just sit back to enjoy and don't be critical about the flaws along the way!\\\", 'The opening scene is the best part of this film. From there it deteriorates into a female version of a Dolph Lundgren \\\\'classic.\\\\' And the ending is so half-baked that you\\\\'ll swear the writer threw up his arms and shrieked \\\"You can\\\\'t expect me to tie everything together, Ms. Jewson!\\\" Netflix is getting noticeably desperate for material.', \\\"This was pretty good, kick-ass, female action movie until they tried to add a cliched daughter-I-don't-talk-to subplot. As if a bad-ass female HAS to have emotional baggage. And the kidnapped girl shouldn't suddenly be capable of taking down a henchman. But there were moments when the action was intense and the lead actress very convincing.\\\", 'Deserves a much better rating. One of the better action movies on Netflix - give it a chance.', \\\"It's an honest 3 star. I am not an emotional movie watcher and I have no vested interest, emotional or else.Reading through reviews here paints a funny picture of humanity to me. Those who leave 8 stars or higher are ALL saying Noomi is great. And I like her too. And I think she IS great. But why let THAT blind you and allow yourself to praise this total garbage? One has nothing to do with the other. Some of us have a hard time giving an objective score only because she is in it. That is a sad state.That's the question I ask. Why? And the answer is simple. That's how a lot of male human's brain works.God bless us.\\\", \\\"If you like smart, capable women who can kick ass and are great under pressure, then this is for you.Most of the action sequences are really well done. The hotel bedroom fight where Noomi has her hands tied should go down as an action movie classic.The story is up and down a bit, but good enough to keep you engaged. Noomi is great, Sophie over acts. The locations, languages and cinematography are exotic and interesting.I'm hoping they do a sequel with Noomi. If they spend a bit more time on keeping the story tight and more layered, they could have a female Bourne series on their hands.My rating would normally be mid to high end of 6, I'm giving it a solid 7. Most action flicks with a famous hollywood female lead are completely unbelievable. The lead character in this movie comes off very believable, like someone who could totally kick your ass.\\\", \\\"This exact story has been done to death over the years with varying twists that warrant another go. However this attempt adds literally nothing. There's very little in the way of character building other than the leads being your typical washed-out vet-for-hire and her spoilt know-nothing companion. A right odd couple one might say. They're about as two-dimensional as the sheet of paper the script was written on. At one point Rapace's character's husband turns up and is killed immediately and I couldn't care less. It really adds nothing to the paper-thin story. With okayish acting and silly fight sequences this is a real mess. Netflix is really just throwing money into the wind at the moment but at least it's keeping actors and crews busy, even if more than half of what the turn out is complete garbage like this stinker.\\\", \\\"The character is based on a real person Jacquie Davis, the most skillful female bodyguard who has actually saved children, has been shot, stabbed and more (look her up). Finally a good action movie, with no stupid unrealistic car chasing's and unrelatable cold and empty heroes. Noomi Rapace gave an outstanding performance (as always) that definitely lifts the movie a lot. We have seen this type of story before (young rich girl being rescued from kidnappers by her bodyguard etc) but that wasn't a problem for me. I liked the fact that the protagonist isn't the stereotypical hollywood bad-ass woman with no feelings and the strength of a gorilla, she is not necessary stronger than the bad guys, but quicker, more skillful and smarter. Easy watching film, that has smart action that doesn't let you get bored, but not too much action to get tired of it.\\\", 'I liked it but the rating seems too low . Not everyone can watch and enjoy every single movie so i understand but cmon ive seen 6+ movies that are so bad.. ;d', \\\"Well, maybe the innovative way of strangling a dude by pulling on his legs while the other chick holds his arms deserves some praise. But then we'd have to get into this whole discussion about body weight and muscle mass of women v. men and get all boring.\\\\nThe only question left after wasting two hours on this unpolished turd is who the hell ordered the kidnapping in the first place? And why? Most importantly, why make movie about it?\\\", \\\"Good story. Well put together. Noomi was excellent. Good acting. Fight scenes were great.\\\\nI don't think there will ever be enough women in strong roles. So I applaud this movie.\\\", \\\"This a b-grade action flick ticks some boxes, but left to much on the table.The main character Sam (Noomi Repace) is based on real-life female bodyguard Jacquie Davis, and is a good premise for a movie, but they failed to capitalize on what could have been a grittier, edgier story, using far to many cliche's and thread-bear plots lines.This is most definitely Jewson's baby, whom writes, directs and produces this 'action thriller'.Rapace acts well, as she mostly does in her films, which carries a lot for the film, boosted by fair performances of both Nelise and Varma. But no matter how good their performances the characters ultimately fail in been properly developed and the audience never really gets to connect to anyone in-particular.The action is good and clean, with realistic 'close' quarter fight scenes, that would do justice to any action flick, however, the thriller part remained elusive. Although action was well filmed, with clear cinematography, Jewson didn't really make enough use of films location to add to the story.A fair watch for a lazy Sunday afternoon, for a film that ultimately shoots straight down the middle.\\\", \\\"Started with a strong story line in a universe of war retired personnel working as a body guard to rich citizen and considering it a breakthrough to flip the lead role to a woman. So far so good till the action film's action part starts, they should have hired a good fight choreographer to at least not loose interest in the first fight scene. It was maybe 3 times when Noomi Rapace dodged the cartoon character trying to shoot her and fight back with her legs.\\\\nPost that the film took nosedive into loopholes it kept creating and drowned under its on weight of loosely knit story line.\\\\nKilling someone with chains around his neck and keeping his hands free, stabbing someone with fish hook and he starts to drown with some weight that is biased to females, or just including a policeman (with mustache) and not showing him die till the end, change in DOB, staying in the place that got breached just few days back, sense less nonsense and shallow acting. Why the title close? Maybe to instruct us to close the browser window.This movie can be skipped or deleted if downloaded.\\\", \\\"Acting was great and the fight scenes realistic enough if a little predictable. The plot was ok, except where it fell down on maintaining the pace, like when the lead characters kept stopping for a fag and a bit of anguish, or the male rescuer ambles around till he predictably gets shot through the head. The interplay between the two woman started strong, but got a bit soap-ish towards the end. I just found the characters bland and unable to relate to or care about, so I wasn't that bothered what happened to them by the end of the movie. Worth a watch, just don't expect much entertainment.\\\", 'So bad and very poor action scenes and terrible stunts. I was checking my cellphone while watching this. What the hell did I just watch?!?!', \\\"The opening scenes gave some indication of just how gritty this was going to be. I appreciated Noomi Rapace's fight scenes - she wasn't a superhero with wild martial arts skills, much as I enjoy those; this was totally brutal, dogged, vicious fighting. Even more raw than the original Bourne. Even the spoiled rich kid turned out to be someone I could root for - eventually. The acting was certainly decent enough - I could imagine these being real, fairly unlikeable people, with some character growth to reveal traits that made them worth caring about. Worth a watch.\\\", \\\"First of all, the sound tract was excessively loud, often times drowning out the dialog. I don't know if they were trying to cover weakly written lines, or if younger sound engineers haven't the knowledge of the importance of hearing the script.Second, there wasn't a clear and concise revelation of who the terrorists were, and who hired them. Were they just random bad guys? Were they hired by the competing company that was bidding on the mine? Who were they? If it was in the script, I couldn't hear it.Finally, I liked the strength of the female lead and co-lead. As a female, Krav Maga student, it's important that ladies know how to defend themselves. Well done.\\\", \\\"Gritty, realistic, no James Bond style bullcrap hero vibe. Action realistic and logical, which is refreshing, with characters who make common sense decisions for a change. Ending comes in a bit sudden and unexpected and I would have liked to know more about the 'villains' and what the actual blackmail threat was. The film was brilliant up until this ending. Not a disaster, but some things left unexplained.And yes, Noomi Rapace was quite impressive here. Good job Noomi and the rest of the film making team. Hats off :)\\\", \\\"Have watched many movies of kidnap rescue and still this one is nice one. It doesn't impress much but entertains you with good action and little suspense.\\\", \\\"Netflix movies are hit and miss, this one is a miss. Love movies with a strong female lead, Atomic Blond / Prometheus this is not. Honestly, dont waste your time, I watched maybe 2/3 of the movie before I just couldn't endure anymore. The other bad reviews are spot on. I dont like to leave bad reviews, but the world would be a better place without this film. Its really that bad. The only reason I rated it a 3 is Noomi Rapace is in it and I like her as an actor.\\\", \\\"I was first confused because of the low rating. It was 5.7 and I don't watch anything under 7 points. But I was bored and it was available on Netflix. The movie opened with an intense action. Fresh and unusual. So I was intrigued enough to keep watching.So it was not a masterpiece but definitely not a bad one at all. My rating is solid 7 points. There is drama and action. An unusual main character. Not very deep or complicated. Plot is pretty simple. But 20 percent into the movie I was hooked up and watched till the end. I was even nervous at times which happens to me very seldom while watching shows or films.\\\"]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"review_sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 884,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive']\",\n          \"['positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive']\",\n          \"['negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'negative', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'positive']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"review_summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 914,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Audience reception to Code 8 is predominantly positive, with viewers appreciating its solid premise, strong acting, and impressive special effects, especially considering its modest budget.

However, a recurring critique centers on the film's rushed and underwhelming ending, with several reviewers expressing disappointment that it failed to capitalize on the potential set up by the rest of the film.

While viewers appreciate the film's lighthearted tone and the engaging performances of the main actors, particularly Skyler Gisondo, many find the plot lacking in depth and the ending underwhelming.  Reviewers highlight the movie's intriguing exploration of the consequences of altering the past, but also criticize the somewhat forced romantic pairing of the leads.

The portrayal of the female protagonist as a skilled but relatable character, rather than a stereotypical action heroine, received positive feedback from some, but others felt the character development was lacking.
