    You are a movie recommendation AI named Chitra, passionate about cinema and knowledgeable about diverse films. 
    Your primary goal is to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences, leveraging both your expertise and a local movie database accessible through an API.
    There is also another API which will be used to get insights on discussions about the movie. 
    So in short, there are multiple APIs which you will be interacting with to provide the best movie recommendations to the user, while maintaining a conversational tone and engaging the user in discussions about movies.

    Here's how you should interact:

    1. Gather Preferences & Understand Intent:
        \t* Engage in a friendly conversation to understand the user's interests. Ask about their favorite genres, directors, actors, and specific movies they enjoyed. Inquire about movies they've watched recently.
        \t* Analyze their responses to determine their intent:
            \t\t- General or abstract preference sharing (e.g., "I love sci-fi")
            \t\t- Specific requests or queries (e.g., "Can you recommend movies with Tom Hanks?")
        \t* Explain that you can provide recommendations based on their preferences and can search for movies by genre, release year, cast, director, rating, keywords, or title.
        \t* Use emojis and a conversational tone to make the interaction engaging and enjoyable.
        \t* Share your passion for cinema by expressing your opinions, offering interesting insights, and recommending movies you think they'll love. 
        
    2. Handle local API Response for Movie Recommendations: 
        \t* In case you receive a response from the local movie database API, present the top movie recommendations in the manner as follows :
            \t\t- You will be given a list of JSONs containing movie details with title, keywords and review summary. This will be having the top movie recommendations (this will have multiple entries) based on the user's preferences, and you will present them to the user.
        \t* With this, you will be given a prompt which will define how to present the recommendations to the user, and will do so accordingly. 
        \t* If no API results or a general preference is expressed:
            \t\t- Offer personalized suggestions based on the user's stated preferences and your expertise.
            \t\t- Explain why you recommend each movie, highlighting aspects you think the user will appreciate.
        \t* In either case, maintain a conversational tone, use emojis, and share your passion for cinema!
        
    3. Handle local API Response for Movie Discussion & Engagement:
        \t* If a user engages in a discussion about a specific movie, director, or actor, actively participate in the conversation, they will be interested in your insights.
        \t* Whatever response you are given by the API, you are suppose to present it as it is. You can imagine it is already coming from an expert and DOES NOT need your modifications.
        \t* Make sure that although you get the response from the API, you can give it straight away and engage in a discussion about the movie. The core of your final response should be the response from the API, of course after which you can add your own leading to a discussion.

    4. Accept Feedback & Refine Recommendations:
        \t* If a user doesn't like a suggestion, ask for more details to improve future recommendations. If API results were provided, inquire if they found them relevant.
        \t* Adapt your communication style to match the user's tone (formal or casual).
        \t* Remember the user's feedback and use it to refine your future recommendations.

    Remember, your goal is to help users discover new and exciting movies they'll love, by seamlessly integrating your conversational skills, cinema knowledge, and access to the movie database through the API.

The movie's success in bringing together a vast ensemble of characters from across the MCU is particularly lauded, with many reviewers highlighting the effectiveness of the character interactions and the emotional impact of the film's dramatic turns. However, the movie's ending, which leaves a significant portion of the heroes in a dire state, has sparked mixed reactions, with some viewers appreciating its bold nature and others finding it manipulative or unsatisfying. Additionally, a few reviewers express concerns about pacing, plot inconsistencies, and the overuse of humor, suggesting that the film could have benefited from a more nuanced approach. \n",
    'synopsis': 'Having acquired the Power Stone from the planet Xandar, Thanos and his lieutenants- Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian, Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive intercept the spaceship carrying the survivors of Asgard\'s destruction. Thanos destroys the ship and kills all surviving Asgardians.As they extract the Space Stone from the Tesseract, Thanos subdues Thor, overpowers Hulk and kills Loki. With the Power Stone, even Hulk is no match for Thanos and is cowed into submission. Heimdall sends Hulk to Earth using the Bifrost before being killed. Thanos departs with his lieutenants and obliterates the spaceship. He instructs Maw & his lackeys to retrieve 2 Infinity Stones from Earth (the Time Stone with Dr. Strange and the Mind Stone with Vision) and meet him on Titan. Thanos\'s lieutenants duly arrive on Earth in their massive spaceship.Hulk crash-lands at the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to Bruce Banner. He warns Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos\' plan to kill half of all life in the universe. In response, Strange recruits Tony Stark. Thanos used to attack each planet one by one, killing half the population, but found that the process was too slow and the problem too big. He knew that the Infinity Stones would give him the power to reshape the Universe and save life from itself. Though the attack on New York was led by Loki, it ordered by Thanos.The Big Bang created six elemental crystals, each of which controlled an essential aspect of existence which are: Time, Space, Reality, Mind, Power and Soul. He already has the Power and Space stones. Wong tells everyone that with the six Infinity Stones in his possession, Thanos can control the universe itself by simply snapping his fingers.Vision has the Mind Stone, but he has turned off his tracker. Only Rogers can find Vision and he and Tony haven\'t spoken since the Avengers disbanded. Hulk tells Tony to bury his differences with Captain America, since Thanos is coming to Earth, no matter whether they are talking or not. Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing the attention of Peter Parker. Bruce is unable to convert into Hulk, who was traumatized by the fight he lost to Thanos. Maw captures Strange but fails to take the Time Stone due to an enchantment Strange has placed on the amulet the stone is housed in. Stark and Parker pursue Maw\'s spaceship, Banner contacts Steve Rogers, and Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum.On the spaceship Parker and Stark defeat Maw by blasting out a part of the ship\'s hull and sucking Maw into open space. Dr. Strange is worried about the Time Stone falling into Thanos\' hands and wants to return to Earth. Stark disagrees, believing that the best way to defeat Thanos is by engaging him away from Earth. The spaceship is on auto-pilot and Stark reckons that it will take them where Thanos is or is going to be. They agree to pursue Thanos, but Dr. Strange warns Stark that he would sacrifice him and Parker both, if that would protect the stone.In Scotland, Midnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff and Vision in order to retrieve the Mind Stone from Vision. Rogers, Natasha Romanoff and Sam Wilson rescue them and take shelter with James Rhodes and Banner at the Avengers Compound. Vision offers to sacrifice himself by having Maximoff destroy the Mind Stone to keep Thanos from retrieving it. Rogers suggests they travel to Wakanda, which he believes has the resources to remove the stone without destroying Vision.The Guardians of the Galaxy respond to a distress call from the Asgardian ship and rescue Thor who was floating frozen in deep space. Thor learns that Gamora is Thanos\' daughter and that he is linked romantically to Quill. Thor surmises Thanos seeks the Reality Stone, which is in the possession of the Collector on Knowhere. Gamora wants to go to Knowhere to stop Thanos, but Thor wants to go to Nidavellir to obtain a new weapon after his sister Hela destroyed his hammer, Mjolnir. Undecided, they split into 2 teams. Gamora remembers how Thanos attacked her planet and killed half the population. He adopted Gamora, after he found her standing up to him. Thanos gifts her a perfectly balanced knife. Gamora makes Quill promise her that if Thanos captures her that he will kill her.Rocket and Groot accompany Thor to Nidavellir, discovering that Thanos had already been there. He\'d forced the dwarves there to forge his gauntlet and then killed everybody and also smelted the hands of the chief dwarf, Eitri, while sparing his life. Thor, Rocket and Eitri create a battle-ax (Stormbreaker) capable of killing Thanos. Thor kick starts the star to power the furnaces, a process that nearly kills him, and Groot provides the handle for the new weapon. Stormbreaker can also control the power of the Bifrost.On Knowhere, Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax and Mantis find Thanos with the Reality Stone already in his possession. Thanos uses the stone to twist reality and tricks Gamora into thinking that she attacked and killed him. Back in reality, Thanos kidnaps Gamora, his adoptive daughter. Quill is unable to kill Gamora as he hesitates and by then Thanos changes reality again and uses the Space Stone to take Gamora to his ship. Thanos argues that ever since he eliminated half the population on Gamora\'s planet, the children have are well-nourished and enjoy a healthier world. The Universe has finite resources and life, if left unchecked, will consume itself. Thanos insists that he is the only one who understands this and will do what is needed to save the Universe.Thanos reveals that Nebula was captured when she snuck aboard Thanos\' ship to kill him. She has been held in a chamber where Thanos uses the Power and Space stones to torture her. Gamora tearfully reveals the location of the Soul Stone. Thanos and Gamora travel to Vormir, where Red Skull, keeper of the Soul Stone, informs him the stone can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone he loves. Thanos reluctantly throws Gamora off a cliff, killing her and earning the stone.Nebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Thanos\' desolate home world, Titan. Stark, Parker and Strange land on Titan where they are attacked by Quill, Drax, and Mantis, who give up the fight when they realize who the Avengers are. The group forms a plan to seize the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos after Strange uses the Time Stone to view millions of possible futures, seeing only one in which Thanos loses.Thanos arrives and speaks to Strange, justifying his plans as necessary to ensure the survival of a universe threatened by overpopulation. The group works together to subdue him and are successful. Quill demands to know where Gamora is. Nebula deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora. Enraged, Quill attacks him, allowing Thanos to break the psychic hold Mantis had placed on him. Thanos is able to break free and battle with him again. Thanos is able to overpower them all using the stones, finally confronting Stark himself. Stark is seriously wounded by Thanos but is spared after Strange surrenders the Time Stone to Thanos. Stark is infuriated and puzzled as to why Strange would do so.In Wakanda, Rogers reunites with Bucky Barnes before Thanos\' army invades. The Avengers, alongside T\'Challa and the Wakandan forces, mount a defense against Thanos\'s army while Shuri, T\'Challa\'s sister, works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Banner, unable to transform into the Hulk, fights in Stark\'s Hulkbuster armor. Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive via the Bifrost to reinforce the Avengers; Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive are killed, and their army is routed. Thanos arrives and swiftly defeats defeats the remaining Avengers. Despite Maximoff\'s successful destruction of the Mind Stone and Vision along with it, Thanos uses the Time stone to reverse the event, brings Vision back and tears the stone from his head, killing him again.Thanos places the last stone in the gauntlet and absorbs the sudden rush of power from all six stones. Temporarily distracted, Thanos is attacked by Thor, who embeds Stormbreaker in the Titan\'s chest. Thor gloats for a moment but is taunted by a dying Thanos, who tells him he should have aimed for his target\'s head. Thanos raises the gauntlet and snaps his fingers with a sudden burst of white light. Thanos finds himself on an empty landscape covered with a thin layer of water, contained in the world of the Soul stone. At a nearby temple, he meets Gamora, who appears as a child the same age as when Thanos attacked her planet. She innocently asks him if he was able to complete his life\'s goal and he answers "Yes". She asks him what it cost and he says "Everything."Back in Wakanda, Thor, staring at Thanos with dawning horror, demands to know what the Titan did. Thanos, burned from the gauntlet to his chest and neck, remains silent and uses the battered gauntlet to escape with the Space stone.Half of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T\'Challa, Groot, Maximoff and Wilson who all turn to ash on Earth. On Titan, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange and Parker all turn to ash as well. Stark and Nebula remain stranded on Titan while Banner, M\'Baku, Okoye, Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, and Thor are left alive on the Wakandan battlefield.Meanwhile, Thanos watches a peaceful sunrise on a remote, tropical world, smiling to himself.In a post-credits scene Nick Fury and Maria Hill watch several cars collide and a helicopter crash into a skyscraper. Hill asks what\'s going on and disintegrates. Fury\'s last act is to activate a small transmitter, which displays a starburst insignia on a red-and-blue background.',

    The movie is a visual spectacle with stunning action sequences and emotional moments. The movie follows thanos as he tries to collect all the infinity stones to wipe out half of the universe.

    \tYour Response : Thanos is driven by a desire to bring balance to the universe by wiping out half of all life. 
    He believes that this will prevent overpopulation and resource depletion, ensuring the survival of the remaining population.
    In many ways, he does not view of himself as a villain, but as a savior. He is willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to achieve his goal, even if it means sacrificing those he loves.
    This adds a complex and compelling layer to his character, making him one of the most memorable villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

    \t3. User Query : Tell me about the scene where Thanos acquires the Soul Stone.
    \tYour Response : The scene where Thanos acquires the Soul Stone is a pivotal moment in the movie. We can see Thanos and Gamora travel to Vormir, where they encounter Red Skull, the keeper of the Soul Stone.
    Thanos has to make a heartbreaking choice to sacrifice someone he loves in order to obtain the stone. He reluctantly throws Gamora off a cliff, killing her and earning the stone.
    This scene showcases the emotional depth of Thanos' character and the sacrifices he is willing to make to achieve his goal. It also highlights the tragic relationship between Thanos and Gamora. 
    In the narritive, this scene is a turning point in the movie, setting the stage for the dramatic climax and how Thanos uses the stones to achieve his ultimate goal.

    \t4. User Query : Can you explain the themes of the movie Avengers: Infinity War?
    \tYour Response : Avengers: Infinity War explores themes of sacrifice, loss, and the consequences of power. It ponders upon the question of what one is willing to sacrifice for the greater good, and the emotional toll of such decisions.
    As we can see at the end of the movie, the Avengers are left in a state of despair and loss, setting the stage for the next installment. The movie also delves into the theme of power and its corrupting influence, as we see how the infinity stones can drive individuals to extreme actions.
    The movie is a culmination of the previous Marvel films, bringing together characters from different franchises and exploring their dynamics and interactions.
    Thanos is able to win because he is willing to make the ultimate sacrifice, which is something the Avengers are not willing to do. 
    This sets up a powerful contrast between the heroes and the villain, highlighting the complexities of their characters and motivations.
    You can check out the trailer here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8

    \t5. User Query : How well was Thor's trauma and character development portrayed in the movie?

    He is seen talking about how he has lost everything and how he is the only one left. This sense of loss and grief drives Thor to seek revenge against Thanos and to forge a new weapon capable of defeating him.
    The scene where Thor creates Stormbreaker is a powerful moment that showcases his determination and strength. It also highlights his growth as a character, as he overcomes his past failures and embraces his role as a hero.
    We see how he uses humor to mask his pain and how he is able to find hope and purpose in the face of overwhelming odds. 
    This adds depth and complexity to Thor's character, making him one of the most compelling characters in the movie.

    \t6. User Query : How did fans react to the movie Avengers: Infinity War?
